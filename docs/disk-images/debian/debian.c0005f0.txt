.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
It's up to you to assign a value here; this value will never be exported
to any 3rd party.  We need it to implement the web-of-trust; it has nothing
to do with the (implicitly created) web-of-certificates.
.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
To build the Web-of-Trust, GnuPG needs to know which keys are
ultimately trusted - those are usually the keys for which you have
access to the secret key.  Answer "yes" to set this key to
ultimately trusted

.

.#gpg.untrusted_key.override
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you want to use this untrusted key anyway, answer "yes".
.

.#gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the user ID of the addressee to whom you want to send the message.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
In general it is not a good idea to use the same key for signing and
encryption.  This algorithm should only be used in certain domains.
Please consult your security expert first.
.

.#gpg.keygen.size
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the size of the key

# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the required value as shown in the prompt.
It is possible to enter a ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) but you won't
get a good error response - instead the system tries to interpret
the given value as an interval.
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.name

# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" (or just "y") if it is okay to generate the sub key.
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.class
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0".
.

.#gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.save.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you really want to delete this user ID.
All certificates are then also lost!
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to delete the subkey
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a valid signature on the key; you normally don't want
to delete this signature because it may be important to establish a
trust connection to the key or another key certified by this key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This signature can't be checked because you don't have the
corresponding key.  You should postpone its deletion until you
know which key was used because this signing key might establish
a trust connection through another already certified key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
The signature is not valid.  It does make sense to remove it from
your keyring.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a signature which binds the user ID to the key. It is
usually not a good idea to remove such a signature.  Actually
GnuPG might not be able to use this key anymore.  So do this
only if this self-signature is for some reason not valid and
a second one is available.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Change the preferences of all user IDs (or just of the selected ones)
to the current list of preferences.  The timestamp of all affected
self-signatures will be advanced by one second.

.

.#gpg.passphrase.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter the passphrase; this is a secret sentence

.

.#gpg.passphrase.repeat
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please repeat the last passphrase, so you are sure what you typed in.
.

.#gpg.detached_signature.filename
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Give the name of the file to which the signature applies
.

.#gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to overwrite the file
.

.#gpg.openfile.askoutname
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter a new filename. If you just hit RETURN the default
file (which is shown in brackets) will be used.
.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.

.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you like, you can enter a text describing why you issue this
revocation certificate.  Please keep this text concise.
An empty line ends the text.

      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
Sie müssen selbst entscheiden, welchen Wert Sie hier eintragen; dieser Wert
wird niemals an eine dritte Seite weitergegeben.  Wir brauchen diesen Wert,
um das "Netz des Vertrauens" aufzubauen.  Dieses hat nichts mit dem
(implizit erzeugten) "Netz der Zertifikate" zu tun.
.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
Um das Web-of-Trust aufzubauen muß GnuPG wissen, welchen Schlüsseln
ultimativ vertraut wird. Das sind üblicherweise die Schlüssel
auf deren geheimen Schlüssel Sie Zugruff haben.
Antworten Sie mit "yes" um diesen Schlüssel ultimativ zu vertrauen

.

.gpg.untrusted_key.override
Wenn Sie diesen nicht vertrauenswürdigen Schlüssel trotzdem benutzen wollen,
so antworten Sie mit "ja".
.

.gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
Geben Sie die User-ID dessen ein, dem Sie die Botschaft senden wollen.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo
Wählen Sie das zu verwendene Verfahren.

DSA (alias DSS) ist der "Digital Signature Algorithm" und kann nur für
Unterschriften genutzt werden.

Elgamal ist ein Verfahren nur für Verschlüsselung.

RSA kann sowohl für Unterschriften als auch für Verschlüsselung genutzt
werden.

Der erste Schlüssel (Hauptschlüssel) muß immer ein Schlüssel sein, mit dem
unterschrieben werden kann.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
Normalerweise ist es nicht gut, denselben Schlüssel zum unterschreiben
und verschlüsseln zu nutzen.  Dieses Verfahren sollte in speziellen
Anwendungsgebiten benutzt werden.  Bitte lassen Sie sich zuerst von
einem Sicherheistexperten beraten.
.

.gpg.keygen.size
Wählen Sie die gewünschte Schlüssellänge
.

.gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.keygen.valid
Geben Sie den benötigten Wert so an, wie er im Prompt erscheint.
Es ist zwar möglich ein "ISO"-Datum (JJJJ-MM-DD) einzugeben, aber man
erhält dann ggfs. keine brauchbaren Fehlermeldungen - stattdessen versucht
der Rechner den Wert als Intervall (von-bis) zu deuten.
.

.gpg.keygen.valid.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.keygen.name
Geben Sie den Namen des Schlüsselinhabers ein.
Beispiel: Heinrich Heine.
.

.gpg.keygen.email
Geben Sie eine Email-Adresse ein. Dies ist zwar nicht unbedingt notwendig,
aber sehr empfehlenswert.
Beispiel: heinrichh@duesseldorf.de
.

.gpg.keygen.comment
Geben Sie - bei Bedarf - einen Kommentar ein.
.

.gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
N  um den Namen zu ändern.
K  um den Kommentar zu ändern.
E  um die Email-Adresse zu ändern.
F  um mit der Schlüsselerzeugung fortzusetzen.
B  um die Schlüsselerzeugung abbrechen.
.

.gpg.keygen.sub.okay
Geben Sie "ja" (oder nur "j") ein, um den Unterschlüssel zu erzeugen.
.

.gpg.sign_uid.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.sign_uid.class
Wenn Sie die User-ID eines Schlüssels beglaubigen wollen, sollten Sie zunächst
sicherstellen, daß der Schlüssel demjenigen gehört, der in der User-ID genannt
ist. Für Dritte ist es hilfreich zu wissen, wie gut diese Zuordnung überprüft
wurde.

"0" zeigt, daß Sie keine bestimmte Aussage über die Sorgfalt der
    Schlüsselzuordnung machen.

"1" Sie glauben, daß der Schlüssel der benannten Person gehört,
    aber Sie konnten oder nahmen die Überpüfung überhaupt nicht vor.
    Dies ist hilfreich für eine "persona"-Überprüfung, wobei man den
    Schlüssel eines Pseudonym-Trägers beglaubigt

"2" Sie nahmen eine flüchtige Überprüfung vor. Das heißt Sie haben z.B.
    den Schlüsselfingerabdruck kontrolliert und die User-ID des Schlüssels
    anhand des Fotos geprüft.

"3" Sie haben eine ausführlich Kontrolle des Schlüssels vorgenommen.
    Das kann z.B. die Kontrolle des Schlüsselfingerabdrucks mit dem
    Schlüsselinhaber persönlich vorgenommen haben; daß Sie die User-ID des
    Schlüssel anhand einer schwer zu fälschenden Urkunde mit Foto (wie z.B.
    einem Paß) abgeglichen haben und schließlich per Email-Verkehr die
    Email-Adresse als zum Schlüsselbesitzer gehörig erkannt haben.

Beachten Sie, daß diese Beispiele für die Antworten 2 und 3 *nur* Beispiele
sind.  Schlußendlich ist es Ihre Sache, was Sie unter "flüchtig" oder
 "ausführlich" verstehen, wenn Sie Schlüssel Dritter beglaubigen.

Wenn Sie nicht wissen, wie Sie antworten sollen, wählen Sie "0".
.

.gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.keyedit.save.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
Geben Sie "ja" oder "nein" ein
.

.gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
Geben Sie "ja" (oder nur "j") ein, um alle User-IDs zu beglaubigen
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
Geben Sie "ja" (oder nur "j") ein, um diese User-ID zu LÖSCHEN.
Alle Zertifikate werden dann auch weg sein!
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
Geben Sie "ja" (oder nur "j") ein, um diesen Unterschlüssel zu löschen
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
Dies ist eine gültige Beglaubigung für den Schlüssel. Es ist normalerweise
unnötig sie zu löschen. Sie ist möglicherweise sogar notwendig, um einen
Trust-Weg zu diesem oder einem durch diesen Schlüssel beglaubigten Schlüssel
herzustellen.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
Diese Beglaubigung kann nicht geprüft werden, da Sie den passenden Schlüssel
nicht besitzen. Sie sollten die Löschung der Beglaubigung verschieben, bis
sie wissen, welcher Schlüssel verwendet wurde. Denn vielleicht würde genau
diese Beglaubigung den "Trust"-Weg komplettieren.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
Diese Beglaubigung ist ungültig. Es ist sinnvoll sie aus Ihrem
Schlüsselbund zu entfernen.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
Diese Beglaubigung bindet die User-ID an den Schlüssel. Normalerweise ist
es nicht gut, solche Beglaubigungen zu entfernen. Um ehrlich zu sein:
Es könnte dann sein, daß GnuPG diesen Schlüssel gar nicht mehr benutzen kann.
Sie sollten diese Eigenbeglaubigung also nur dann entfernen, wenn sie aus
irgendeinem Grund nicht gültig ist und eine zweite Beglaubigung verfügbar ist.
.

.gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
Ändern der Voreinstellung aller User-IDs (oder nur der ausgewählten)
auf die aktuelle Liste der Voreinstellung. Die Zeitangaben aller betroffenen
Eigenbeglaubigungen werden um eine Sekunde vorgestellt.

.

.gpg.passphrase.enter
Bitte geben Sie die Passphrase ein. Dies ist ein geheimer Satz

.

.gpg.passphrase.repeat
Um sicher zu gehen, daß Sie sich bei der Eingabe der Passphrase nicht
vertippt haben, geben Sie diese bitte nochmal ein.  Nur wenn beide Eingaben
übereinstimmen, wird die Passphrase akzeptiert.
.

.gpg.detached_signature.filename
Geben Sie den Namen der Datei an, zu dem die abgetrennte Unterschrift gehört
.

.gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
Geben Sie "ja" ein, wenn Sie die Datei überschreiben möchten
.

.gpg.openfile.askoutname
Geben Sie bitte einen neuen Dateinamen ein. Falls Sie nur die
Eingabetaste betätigen, wird der (in Klammern angezeigte) Standarddateiname
verwendet.
.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
Sie sollten einen Grund für die Zertifizierung angeben. Je nach
Zusammenhang können Sie aus dieser Liste auswählen:
  "Schlüssel wurde kompromitiert"
      Falls Sie Grund zu der Annahme haben, daß nicht berechtigte Personen
      Zugriff zu Ihrem geheimen Schlüssel hatten
  "Schlüssel ist überholt"
      Falls Sie diesen Schlüssel durch einem neuen ersetzt haben.
  "Schlüssel wird nicht mehr benutzt"
      Falls Sie diesen Schlüssel zurückgezogen haben.
  "User-ID ist nicht mehr gültig"
      Um bekanntzugeben, daß die User-ID nicht mehr benutzt werden soll.
      So weist man normalerweise auf eine ungültige Emailadresse hin.

.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
Wenn Sie möchten, können Sie hier einen Text eingeben, der darlegt, warum
Sie diesen Widerruf herausgeben.  Der Text sollte möglichst knapp sein.
Eine Leerzeile beendet die Eingabe.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
It's up to you to assign a value here; this value will never be exported
to any 3rd party.  We need it to implement the web-of-trust; it has nothing
to do with the (implicitly created) web-of-certificates.
.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
To build the Web-of-Trust, GnuPG needs to know which keys are
ultimately trusted - those are usually the keys for which you have
access to the secret key.  Answer "yes" to set this key to
ultimately trusted

.

.#gpg.untrusted_key.override
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you want to use this untrusted key anyway, answer "yes".
.

.#gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the user ID of the addressee to whom you want to send the message.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
In general it is not a good idea to use the same key for signing and
encryption.  This algorithm should only be used in certain domains.
Please consult your security expert first.
.

.#gpg.keygen.size
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the size of the key
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the required value as shown in the prompt.
It is possible to enter a ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) but you won't
get a good error response - instead the system tries to interpret
the given value as an interval.
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.name
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the name of the key holder
.

.#gpg.keygen.email
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
please enter an optional but highly suggested email address
.

.#gpg.keygen.comment
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter an optional comment
.

.#gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
N  to change the name.
C  to change the comment.
E  to change the email address.
O  to continue with key generation.
Q  to to quit the key generation.
.

.#gpg.keygen.sub.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" (or just "y") if it is okay to generate the sub key.
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.class
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0".
.

.#gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.save.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you really want to delete this user ID.
All certificates are then also lost!
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to delete the subkey
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a valid signature on the key; you normally don't want
to delete this signature because it may be important to establish a
trust connection to the key or another key certified by this key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This signature can't be checked because you don't have the
corresponding key.  You should postpone its deletion until you
know which key was used because this signing key might establish
a trust connection through another already certified key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
The signature is not valid.  It does make sense to remove it from
your keyring.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a signature which binds the user ID to the key. It is
usually not a good idea to remove such a signature.  Actually
GnuPG might not be able to use this key anymore.  So do this
only if this self-signature is for some reason not valid and
a second one is available.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Change the preferences of all user IDs (or just of the selected ones)
to the current list of preferences.  The timestamp of all affected
self-signatures will be advanced by one second.

.

.#gpg.passphrase.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter the passphrase; this is a secret sentence

.

.#gpg.passphrase.repeat
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please repeat the last passphrase, so you are sure what you typed in.
.

.#gpg.detached_signature.filename
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Give the name of the file to which the signature applies
.

.#gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to overwrite the file
.

.#gpg.openfile.askoutname
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter a new filename. If you just hit RETURN the default
file (which is shown in brackets) will be used.
.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.

.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you like, you can enter a text describing why you issue this
revocation certificate.  Please keep this text concise.
An empty line ends the text.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
It's up to you to assign a value here; this value will never be exported
to any 3rd party.  We need it to implement the web-of-trust; it has nothing
to do with the (implicitly created) web-of-certificates.
.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
To build the Web-of-Trust, GnuPG needs to know which keys are
ultimately trusted - those are usually the keys for which you have
access to the secret key.  Answer "yes" to set this key to
ultimately trusted

.

.#gpg.untrusted_key.override
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you want to use this untrusted key anyway, answer "yes".
.

.#gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the user ID of the addressee to whom you want to send the message.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
In general it is not a good idea to use the same key for signing and
encryption.  This algorithm should only be used in certain domains.
Please consult your security expert first.
.

.#gpg.keygen.size
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the size of the key
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the required value as shown in the prompt.
It is possible to enter a ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) but you won't
get a good error response - instead the system tries to interpret
the given value as an interval.
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.name
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the name of the key holder
.

.#gpg.keygen.email
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
please enter an optional but highly suggested email address
.

.#gpg.keygen.comment
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter an optional comment
.

.#gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
N  to change the name.
C  to change the comment.
E  to change the email address.
O  to continue with key generation.
Q  to to quit the key generation.
.

.#gpg.keygen.sub.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" (or just "y") if it is okay to generate the sub key.
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.class
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0".
.

.#gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.save.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you really want to delete this user ID.
All certificates are then also lost!
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to delete the subkey
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a valid signature on the key; you normally don't want
to delete this signature because it may be important to establish a
trust connection to the key or another key certified by this key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This signature can't be checked because you don't have the
corresponding key.  You should postpone its deletion until you
know which key was used because this signing key might establish
a trust connection through another already certified key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
The signature is not valid.  It does make sense to remove it from
your keyring.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a signature which binds the user ID to the key. It is
usually not a good idea to remove such a signature.  Actually
GnuPG might not be able to use this key anymore.  So do this
only if this self-signature is for some reason not valid and
a second one is available.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Change the preferences of all user IDs (or just of the selected ones)
to the current list of preferences.  The timestamp of all affected
self-signatures will be advanced by one second.

.

.#gpg.passphrase.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter the passphrase; this is a secret sentence

.

.#gpg.passphrase.repeat
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please repeat the last passphrase, so you are sure what you typed in.
.

.#gpg.detached_signature.filename
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Give the name of the file to which the signature applies
.

.#gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to overwrite the file
.

.#gpg.openfile.askoutname
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter a new filename. If you just hit RETURN the default
file (which is shown in brackets) will be used.
.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.

.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you like, you can enter a text describing why you issue this
revocation certificate.  Please keep this text concise.
An empty line ends the text.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
Está en su mano asignar un valor aquí. Dicho valor nunca será exportado a
terceros. Es necesario para implementar la red de confianza, no tiene nada
que ver con la red de certificados (implícitamente creada).
.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
Para construir la Red-de-Confianza, GnuPG necesita saber qué claves
tienen confianza absoluta - normalmente son las claves para las que usted
puede acceder a la clave secreta. Conteste "sí" para hacer que esta
clave se considere como de total confianza

.

.gpg.untrusted_key.override
Si quiere usar esta clave no fiable de todos modos, conteste "sí".
.

.gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
Introduzca el ID de usuario al que quiere enviar el mensaje.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo
Seleccione el algoritmo que usar.

DSA (alias DSS) es el Algoritmo de Firma Digital y sólo se usa para firmas.

Elgamal es un algoritmo sólo para cifrar.

RSA sirve tanto para firmar como para cifrar.

La primera clave (clave primaria) debe ser siempre de tipo capaz de firmar.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
En general no es una buena idea usar la misma clave para firmar y
cifrar. Este algoritmo debéria usarse solo en ciertos contextos.
Por favor consulte primero a un experto en seguridad.
.

.gpg.keygen.size
Introduzca la longitud de la clave
.

.gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.keygen.valid
Introduzca el valor requerido conforme se muestra.
Es posible introducir una fecha ISO (AAAA-MM-DD), pero no se obtendrá una
buena respuesta a los errores; el sistema intentará interpretar el valor
introducido como un intervalo.
.

.gpg.keygen.valid.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.keygen.name
Introduzca el nombre del dueño de la clave
.

.gpg.keygen.email
Introduzca una dirección de correo electrónico (opcional pero muy
recomendable)
.

.gpg.keygen.comment
Introduzca un comentario opcional
.

.gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
N  para cambiar el nombre.
C  para cambiar el comentario.
E  para cambiar la dirección.
O  para continuar con la generación de clave.
S  para interrumpir la generación de clave.
.

.gpg.keygen.sub.okay
Responda "sí" (o sólo "s") para generar la subclave.
.

.gpg.sign_uid.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.sign_uid.class
Cuando firme un ID de usuario en una clave, debería verificar que la clave
pertenece a la persona que se nombra en el ID de usuario. Es útil para
otros saber cómo de cuidadosamente lo ha verificado.

"0" significa que no hace ninguna declaración concreta sobre como ha
      comprobado la validez de la clave.

"1" significa que cree que la clave pertenece a la persona que declara
      poseerla pero no pudo o no verificó la clave en absoluto. Esto es útil
      para una verificación en persona cuando firmas la clave de un usuario
      pseudoanónimo.

"2" significa que hizo una comprobación informal de la clave. Por ejemplo
      podría querer decir que comprobó la huella dactilar de la clave y
      comprobó el ID de usuario en la clave con un ID fotográfico.

"3" significa que hizo una comprobación exhaustiva de la clave. Por
      ejemplo verificando la huella dactilar de la clave con el propietario
      de la clave, y que comprobó, mediante un documento difícil de falsificar
      con ID fotográfico (como un pasaporte) que el nombre del poseedor de la
      clave coincide con el ID de usuario en la clave y finalmente que verificó
      (intercambiando email) que la dirección de email de la clave pertenece
      al poseedor de la clave.

Observe que los ejemplos dados en los niveles 2 y 3 son *solo* ejemplos.
En definitiva, usted decide lo que significa "informal" y "exhaustivo"
para usted cuando firma las claves de otros.

Si no sabe qué contestar, conteste "0".
.

.gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.keyedit.save.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
Responda "sí" o "no"
.

.gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
Responda "sí" si quiere firmar TODOS los IDs de usuario
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
Responda "sí" si realmente quiere borrar este ID de usuario.
¡También se perderán todos los certificados!
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
Responda "sí" si quiere borrar esta subclave
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
Esta es una firma válida de esta clave. Normalmente no será deseable
borrar esta firma ya que puede ser importante para establecer una conexión
de confianza con la clave o con otra clave certificada por ésta.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
Esta firma no puede ser comprobada porque no tiene Vd. la clave
correspondiente. Debería posponer su borrado hasta conocer qué clave
se usó, ya que dicha clave podría establecer una conexión de confianza
a través de otra clave certificada.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
Esta firma no es válida. Tiene sentido borrarla de su anillo.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
Esta es una firma que une el ID de usuario a la clave. No suele ser una
buena idea borrar dichas firmas. De hecho, GnuPG podría no ser capaz de
volver a usar esta clave. Así que bórrela tan sólo si esta autofirma no
es válida por alguna razón y hay otra disponible.
.

.gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
Cambiar las preferencias de todos los IDs de usuario (o sólo los 
seleccionados) a la lista actual de preferencias. El sello de tiempo
de todas las autofirmas afectadas se avanzará en un segundo.

.

.gpg.passphrase.enter
Por favor introduzca la contraseña: una frase secreta 

.

.gpg.passphrase.repeat
Repita la última frase contraseña para asegurarse de lo que tecleó.
.

.gpg.detached_signature.filename
Introduzca el nombre del fichero al que corresponde la firma
.

.gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
Responda "sí" para sobreescribir el fichero
.

.gpg.openfile.askoutname
Introduzca un nuevo nombre de fichero. Si pulsa INTRO se usará el fichero
por omisión (mostrado entre corchetes).
.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
Debería especificar un motivo para la certificación. Dependiendo del
contexto puede elegir una opción de esta lista:
  "La clave ha sido comprometida"
      Use esto si tiene razones para pensar que personas no autorizadas
      tuvieron acceso a su clave secreta.
  "La clave ha sido sustituida"
      Use esto si ha reemplazado la clave por otra más nueva.
  "La clave ya no está en uso"
      Use esto si ha dejado de usar esta clave.
  "La identificación de usuario ya no es válida"
      Use esto para señalar que la identificación de usuario no debería
      seguir siendo usada; esto se utiliza normalmente para marcar una
      dirección de correo-e como inválida.

.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
Si lo desea puede introducir un texto explicando por qué emite
este certificado de revocación. Por favor, que el texto sea breve.
Una línea vacía pone fin al texto.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
It's up to you to assign a value here; this value will never be exported
to any 3rd party.  We need it to implement the web-of-trust; it has nothing
to do with the (implicitly created) web-of-certificates.
.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
To build the Web-of-Trust, GnuPG needs to know which keys are
ultimately trusted - those are usually the keys for which you have
access to the secret key.  Answer "yes" to set this key to
ultimately trusted

.

.#gpg.untrusted_key.override
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you want to use this untrusted key anyway, answer "yes".
.

.#gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the user ID of the addressee to whom you want to send the message.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
In general it is not a good idea to use the same key for signing and
encryption.  This algorithm should only be used in certain domains.
Please consult your security expert first.
.

.#gpg.keygen.size
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the size of the key
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay

.

.#gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the required value as shown in the prompt.
It is possible to enter a ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) but you won't
get a good error response - instead the system tries to interpret
the given value as an interval.
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.

.#gpg.sign_uid.class
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0".
.

.#gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.save.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you really want to delete this user ID.
All certificates are then also lost!
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to delete the subkey
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a valid signature on the key; you normally don't want
to delete this signature because it may be important to establish a
trust connection to the key or another key certified by this key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This signature can't be checked because you don't have the
corresponding key.  You should postpone its deletion until you
know which key was used because this signing key might establish
a trust connection through another already certified key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
The signature is not valid.  It does make sense to remove it from
your keyring.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a signature which binds the user ID to the key. It is
usually not a good idea to remove such a signature.  Actually
GnuPG might not be able to use this key anymore.  So do this
only if this self-signature is for some reason not valid and
a second one is available.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Change the preferences of all user IDs (or just of the selected ones)
to the current list of preferences.  The timestamp of all affected
self-signatures will be advanced by one second.

.

.#gpg.passphrase.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter the passphrase; this is a secret sentence

.

.#gpg.passphrase.repeat
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please repeat the last passphrase, so you are sure what you typed in.
.

.#gpg.detached_signature.filename
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Give the name of the file to which the signature applies
.

.#gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to overwrite the file
.

.#gpg.openfile.askoutname
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter a new filename. If you just hit RETURN the default
file (which is shown in brackets) will be used.
.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.

.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you like, you can enter a text describing why you issue this
revocation certificate.  Please keep this text concise.
An empty line ends the text.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
Tämän arvon määrittäminen on sinun tehtäväsi, tätä arvoa ei koskaan 
kerrota kolmansille osapuolille. Tarvitsemme sitä toteuttamaan 
luottamusverkko eikä sillä ei ole mitään tekemistä (epäsuorasti luotujen) 
varmenneverkkojen kanssa.
.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
Rakentaakseen luottamusverkon, GnuPG:n täytyy tietää mihin avaimiin 
luotetaan ehdottomasti - nämä ovat tavallisesti ne avaimet, joiden salainen 
pari on sinulla.  Vastaa "kyllä" luottaaksesi tähän avaimeen ehdoitta

.

.gpg.untrusted_key.override
Vastaa "kyllä" jos haluat kaikesta huolimatta käyttää tätä epäluotettavaa
avainta.
.

.gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
Syötä vastaanottajan, jolle haluat lähettää viestin, käyttäjätunnus.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
Yleensä ei ole järkevää käyttää samaa avainta allekirjoitukseen
ja salaamiseen. Tätä algorimiä tulisi käyttää vain määrätyissä ympäristöissä.
Ole hyvä ja kysy tietoturva-asiantuntijaltasi ensin
.

.gpg.keygen.size
Syötä avaimen koko
.

.gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.gpg.keygen.valid
Syötä pyydetty arvo kuten näkyy kehotteessa.
On mahdollista syöttää ISO-muotoinen päivä (VVVV-KK-PP),
mutta sen seurauksena et saa kunnollista virheilmoitusta 
vaan järjestelmä yrittää tulkita arvon aikajaksona.
.

.gpg.keygen.valid.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.gpg.keygen.name
Anna avaimen haltijan nimi
.

.gpg.keygen.email
anna vapaaehtoinen, mutta erittäin suositeltava sähköpostiosoite
.

.gpg.keygen.comment
Kirjoita vapaaehtoinen huomautus
.

.gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
N   muuta nimeä
C   muuta kommenttia
E   muuta sähköpostiosoitetta
O   jatka avaimen luomista
L   lopeta
.

.gpg.keygen.sub.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" (tai vain "k") jos haluat luoda aliavaimen.
.

.gpg.sign_uid.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.gpg.sign_uid.class
Allekirjoittaessasi avaimen käyttäjätunnuksen sinun tulisi varmista, että 
avain todella kuuluu henkilölle, joka mainitaan käyttäjätunnuksessa.  Muiden 
on hyvä tietää kuinka huolellisesti olet varmistanut tämän. 

"0" tarkoittaa, että et väitä mitään siitä, kuinka huolellisesti olet
    varmistanut avaimen.

"1" tarkoittaa, että uskot avaimen kuuluvan henkilölle, joka väittää 
    hallitsevan sitä, mutta et voinut varmistaa tai et varmistanut avainta 
    lainkaan.  Tämä on hyödyllinen "persoonan" varmistamiseen, jossa 
    allekirjoitat pseudonyymin käyttäjän avaimen.

"2" tarkoittaa arkista varmistusta.  Esimerkiksi olet varmistanut 
    avaimen sormenjäljen ja tarkistanut käyttäjätunnuksen ja 
    valokuvatunnisteen täsmäävän.

"3" tarkoittaa syvällistä henkilöllisyyden varmistamista.  Esimerkiksi 
    tämä voi tarkoittaa avaimen sormenjäljen tarkistamista avaimen haltijan 
    kanssa henkilökohtaisesti, ja että tarkistit nimen avaimessa täsmäävän 
    vaikeasti väärennettävän kuvallisen henkilöllisyystodistuksen (kuten 
    passi) kanssa, ja lopuksi varmistit (sähköpostin vaihtamisella), että 
    sähköpostiosoite kuuluu avaimen haltijalle.

Huomaa, että yllä annetut esimerkit tasoille 2 ja 3 ovat todellakin *vain* 
esimerkkejä.  Lopullisesti se on sinun päätöksesi mitä "arkinen" ja 
"syvällinen" tarkoittaa allekirjoittaessasi muita avaimia.

Jos et tiedä mikä olisi sopiva vastaus, vastaa "0".
.

.gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.gpg.keyedit.save.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
Vastaa "kyllä" tai " ei"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
Vastaa "kyllä", jos haluat poistaa tämän käyttäjätunnuksen.
Menetät samalla kaikki siihen liittyvät varmenteet!
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
Vastaa "kyllä", jos aliavaimen voi poistaa
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
Tämä on voimassa oleva allekirjoitus tälle avaimelle, tavallisesti ei 
kannata poistaa tätä allekirjoitusta koska se saattaa olla tarpeen
luottamussuhteen luomiseksi avaimeen tai johonkin toiseen tämän avaimen
varmentamaan avaimeen.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
Allekirjoitusta ei voida tarkistaa koska sinulla ei ole 
siihen liittyvää avainta. Lykkää sen poistamista kunnes
 tiedät mitä avainta on käytetty, koska allekirjoitus 
avain saattaa luoda luottamusketjun toisen, jo ennalta 
varmennetun avaimen kautta.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
Allekirjoitus ei ole pätevä.  Järkevintä olisi poistaa se 
avainrenkaastasi.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
Tämä allekirjoitus takaa avaimen haltijan henkilöllisyyden. 
Tällaisen allekirjoituksen poistaminen on tavallisesti huono 
ajatus.  GnuPG ei kenties voi käyttää avainta enää.  Poista 
allekirjoitus vain, jos se ei ole jostain syystä pätevä, ja 
avaimella on jo toinen allekirjoitus.
.

.gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
Muuta valinnat kaikille käyttäjätunnuksille (tai vain valituille)
nykyiseen luetteloon valinnoista.  Kaikkien muutettujen
oma-allekirjoitusten aikaleima siirretään yhdellä sekunnilla eteenpäin.

.

.gpg.passphrase.enter
Ole hyvä ja syötä salasana, tämän on salainen lause 

.

.gpg.passphrase.repeat
Toista edellinen salasanasi varmistuaksesi siitä, mitä kirjoitit.
.

.gpg.detached_signature.filename
Anna allekirjoitetun tiedoston nimi
.

.gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
Vastaa "kyllä", jos tiedoston voi ylikirjoittaa
.

.gpg.openfile.askoutname
Syötä uusi tiedostonimi. Jos painat vain RETURN, käytetään
oletustiedostoa (joka näkyy sulkeissa).
.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
Sinun tulisi määrittää syy varmenteelle. Riippuen asiayhteydestä
voit valita tästä listasta:
  "Avain on paljastunut"
      Käytä tätä, jos sinulla on syytä uskoa, että luvattomat henkilöt 
      ovat saaneet salaisen avaimesi käsiinsä.
  "Avain on korvattu"
      Käytä tätä, jos olet korvannut tämän uudemmalla avaimella.
  "Avain ei ole enää käytössä"
      Käytä tätä, jost ole lopettanut tämän avaimen käytön.
  "Käyttäjätunnus ei ole enää voimassa"
      Käytä tätä ilmoittamaan, että käyttäjätunnusta ei pitäisi käyttää;
      tätä normaalisti käytetään merkitsemään sähköpostiosoite vanhenneeksi.

.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
Halutessasi voit kirjoittaa tähän kuvauksen miksi julkaiset tämän
mitätöintivarmenteen.  Kirjoita lyhyesti.
Tyhjä rivi päättää tekstin.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
C'est à vous d'assigner une valeur ici; cette valeur ne sera jamais
envoyée à une tierce personne. Nous en avons besoin pour créer le réseau
de confiance (web-of-trust); cela n'a rien à voir avec le réseau des
certificats (créé implicitement)
.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
Pour mettre en place le Réseau de confiance (Web of Trust), GnuPG a
besoin de savoir en quelles clés votre confiance est ultime - ce sont
en général les clés dont vous avez accès à la clé secrète. Répondez
"oui" pour indiquer que votre confiance en cette clé est ultime

.

.gpg.untrusted_key.override
Si vous voulez utiliser cette clé peu sûre quand-même, répondez «oui».
.

.gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
Entrez le nom d'utilisateur de la personne à qui vous voulez envoyer
le message.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo
Sélectionnez l'algorithme à utiliser.

DSA (connu également sous le nom de DSS) est un algorithme de signature
digitale et ne peut être utilisé que pour des signatures.

Elgamal est un algorithme pour le chiffrement seul.

RSA peut être utilisé pour les signatures et le chiffrement.

La première clé (clé principale) doit toujours être une clé capable
de signer.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
En général ce n'est pas une bonne idée d'utiliser la même clé pour
signer et pour chiffrer. Cet algorithme ne doit être utilisé que
pour certains domaines.
Consultez votre expert en sécurité d'abord.
.

.gpg.keygen.size
Entrez la taille de la clé
.

.gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.keygen.valid
Entrez la valeur demandée comme indiqué dans la ligne de commande.
On peut entrer une date ISO (AAAA-MM-JJ) mais le résultat d'erreur sera
mauvais - le système essaierait d'interpréter la valeur donnée comme un
intervalle.
.

.gpg.keygen.valid.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.keygen.name
Entrez le nom du propriétaire de la clé
.

.gpg.keygen.email
entrez une adresse e-mail optionnelle mais hautement recommandée
.

.gpg.keygen.comment
Entrez un commentaire optionnel
.

.gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
N pour changer le nom.
C pour changer le commentaire.
E pour changer l'adresse e-mail.
O pour continuer à générer la clé.
Q pour arrêter de générer de clé.
.

.gpg.keygen.sub.okay
Répondez «oui» (ou simplement «o») pour générer la sous-clé
.

.gpg.sign_uid.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.sign_uid.class
Quand vous signez un nom d'utilisateur d'une clé, vous devriez d'abord
vérifier que la clé appartient à la personne nommée. Il est utile que
les autres personnes sachent avec quel soin vous l'avez vérifié.

"0" signifie que vous n'avez pas d'opinon.

"1" signifie que vous croyez que la clé appartient à la personne qui
dit la posséder mais vous n'avez pas pu vérifier du tout la clé.
C'est utile lorsque vous signez la clé d'un pseudonyme.

"2" signifie que vous avez un peu vérifié la clé. Par exemple, cela
pourrait être un vérification de l'empreinte et du nom de
l'utilisateur avec la photo.

"3" signifie que vous avez complètement vérifié la clé. Par exemple,
cela pourrait être une vérification de l'empreinte, du nom de
l'utilisateur avec un document difficile à contrefaire (comme un
passeport) et de son adresse e-mail (vérifié par un échange de
courrier électronique).

Notez bien que les exemples donnés ci-dessus pour les niveaux 2 et
3 ne sont *que* des exemples.
C'est à vous de décider quelle valeur mettre quand vous signez
les clés des autres personnes.

Si vous ne savez pas quelle réponse est la bonne, répondez "0".
.

.gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.keyedit.save.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
Répondez «oui» ou «non»
.

.gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
Répondez «oui» si vous voulez signer TOUS les noms d'utilisateurs
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
Répondez «oui» si vous voulez vraiment supprimer ce nom
d'utilisateur. Tous les certificats seront alors perdus en même temps !
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
Répondez «oui» s'il faut vraiment supprimer la sous-clé
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
C'est une signature valide dans la clé; vous n'avez pas normalement
intérêt à supprimer cette signature car elle peut être importante pour
établir une connection de confiance vers la clé ou une autre clé certifiée
par celle-là.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
Cette signature ne peut pas être vérifiée parce que vous n'avez pas la
clé correspondante. Vous devriez remettre sa supression jusqu'à ce que
vous soyez sûr de quelle clé a été utilisée car cette clé de signature
peut établir une connection de confiance vers une autre clé déjà certifiée.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
Cette signature n'est pas valide. Vous devriez la supprimer de votre
porte-clés.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
Cette signature relie le nom d'utilisateur à la clé. Habituellement
enlever une telle signature n'est pas une bonne idée. En fait GnuPG peut
ne plus être capable d'utiliser cette clé. Donc faites ceci uniquement si
cette auto-signature est invalide pour une certaine raison et si une autre
est disponible.
.

.gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
Changer les préférences de tous les noms d'utilisateurs (ou juste
ceux qui sont sélectionnés) vers la liste actuelle. La date de toutes
les auto-signatures affectées seront avancées d'une seconde.

.

.gpg.passphrase.enter
Entrez le mot de passe ; c'est une phrase secrète 

.

.gpg.passphrase.repeat
Répétez la dernière phrase de passe pour être sûr de ce que vous
avez tapé.
.

.gpg.detached_signature.filename
Donnez le nom du fichier auquel la signature se rapporte
.

.gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
Répondez «oui» s'il faut vraiment réécrire le fichier
.

.gpg.openfile.askoutname
Entrez le nouveau nom de fichier. Si vous tapez simplement ENTRÉE le
fichier par défaut (indiqué entre crochets) sera utilisé.
.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
Vous devriez donner une raison pour la certification. Selon le contexte
vous pouvez choisir dans cette liste:
  «La clé a été compromise»
      Utilisez cette option si vous avez une raison de croire que des
      personnes ont pu accéder à votre clé secrète sans autorisation.
  «La clé a été remplacée»
      Utilisez cette option si vous avez remplacé la clé par une nouvelle.
  «La clé n'est plus utilisée»
      Utilisez cette option si cette clé n'a plus d'utilité.
  «Le nom d'utilisateur n'est plus valide»
      Utilisez cette option si le nom d'utilisateur ne doit plus être
      utilisé. Cela sert généralement à indiquer qu'une adresse e-mail
      est invalide.

.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
Si vous le désirez, vous pouvez entrer un texte qui explique pourquoi vous
avez émis ce certificat de révocation. Essayez de garder ce texte concis.
Une ligne vide délimite la fin du texte.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
It's up to you to assign a value here; this value will never be exported
to any 3rd party.  We need it to implement the web-of-trust; it has nothing
to do with the (implicitly created) web-of-certificates.
.

.#gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
To build the Web-of-Trust, GnuPG needs to know which keys are
ultimately trusted - those are usually the keys for which you have
access to the secret key.  Answer "yes" to set this key to
ultimately trusted

.

.#gpg.untrusted_key.override
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you want to use this untrusted key anyway, answer "yes".
.

.#gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the user ID of the addressee to whom you want to send the message.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
In general it is not a good idea to use the same key for signing and
encryption.  This algorithm should only be used in certain domains.
Please consult your security expert first.
.

.#gpg.keygen.size
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the size of the key
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the required value as shown in the prompt.
It is possible to enter a ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) but you won't
get a good error response - instead the system tries to interpret
the given value as an interval.
.

.#gpg.keygen.valid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keygen.name
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Enter the name of the key holder
.

.#gpg.keygen.email
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
please enter an optional but highly suggested email address
.

.#gpg.keygen.comment
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter an optional comment
.

.#gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
N  to change the name.
C  to change the comment.
E  to change the email address.
O  to continue with key generation.
Q  to to quit the key generation.
.

.#gpg.keygen.sub.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" (or just "y") if it is okay to generate the sub key.
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.sign_uid.class
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0".
.

.#gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.save.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" or "no"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you really want to delete this user ID.
All certificates are then also lost!
.

.#gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to delete the subkey
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a valid signature on the key; you normally don't want
to delete this signature because it may be important to establish a
trust connection to the key or another key certified by this key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This signature can't be checked because you don't have the
corresponding key.  You should postpone its deletion until you
know which key was used because this signing key might establish
a trust connection through another already certified key.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
The signature is not valid.  It does make sense to remove it from
your keyring.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
This is a signature which binds the user ID to the key. It is
usually not a good idea to remove such a signature.  Actually
GnuPG might not be able to use this key anymore.  So do this
only if this self-signature is for some reason not valid and
a second one is available.
.

.#gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Change the preferences of all user IDs (or just of the selected ones)
to the current list of preferences.  The timestamp of all affected
self-signatures will be advanced by one second.

.

.#gpg.passphrase.enter
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter the passphrase; this is a secret sentence

.

.#gpg.passphrase.repeat
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please repeat the last passphrase, so you are sure what you typed in.
.

.#gpg.detached_signature.filename
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Give the name of the file to which the signature applies
.

.#gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if it is okay to overwrite the file
.

.#gpg.openfile.askoutname
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Please enter a new filename. If you just hit RETURN the default
file (which is shown in brackets) will be used.
.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.

.

.#gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
If you like, you can enter a text describing why you issue this
revocation certificate.  Please keep this text concise.
An empty line ends the text.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
Az Ön döntésén múlik, hogy milyen értéket ad meg itt. Ezt az értéket soha
nem exportáljuk mások részére. Ez a bizalmak hálózatához (web-of-trust)
szükséges, semmi köze az igazolások hálózatához (web-of-certificates).
.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
Hogy a bizalmak hálózatát felépítsük, a GnuPG-nek tudnia kell, hogy
mely kulcsok alapvetően megbízhatóak - általában ezek azok a kulcsok,
melyek titkos kulcsához hozzáfér. Válaszoljon "igen"-nel, ha kulcsot
alapvetően megbízhatónak jelöli!

.

.gpg.untrusted_key.override
Ha mégis használni akarja ezt a kulcsot, melyben nem bízunk,
válaszoljon "igen"-nel!
.

.gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
Adja meg a címzett felhasználói azonosítóját!
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
Általában nem jó ötlet ugyanazt a kulcsot használni aláíráshoz és
titkosításhoz. Ezt az algoritmust csak bizonyos területeken ajánlatos
használni. Kérem, először konzultáljon a biztonsági szakértőjével!
.

.gpg.keygen.size
Adja meg a kulcs méretét!
.

.gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
Kérem, adjon "igen" vagy "nem" választ!
.

.gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
Kérem, adjon "igen" vagy "nem" választ!
.

.gpg.keygen.valid
Adja meg a szükséges értéket, ahogy a prompt mutatja!
Lehetséges ISO dátumot is beírni (ÉÉÉÉ-HH-NN), de nem fog rendes
hibaüzenetet kapni, hanem a rendszer megpróbálja az értéket
intervallumként értelmezni.

Adja meg a kulcs tulajdonosának a nevét!
.

.gpg.keygen.sub.okay
Válaszoljon "igen"-nel (vagy csak "i"-vel), ha kezdhetjük az alkulcs
létrehozását!
.

.gpg.sign_uid.okay
Kérem, adjon "igen" vagy "nem" választ!
.

.gpg.sign_uid.class
Mielőtt aláír egy felhasználói azonosítót egy kulcson, ellenőriznie kell,
hogy a kulcs a felhasználói azonosítóban megnevezett személyhez tartozik.
Mások számára hasznos lehet, ha tudják, hogy milyen gondosan ellenőrizte
Ön ezt.

"0" azt jelenti, hogy nem tesz az ellenőrzés gondosságára vonatkozó
    kijelentést.

"1" azt jelenti, hogy Ön hiszi, hogy a kulcs annak a személynek a
    tulajdona, aki azt állítja, hogy az övé, de Ön nem tudta ezt
    ellenőrizni, vagy egyszerűen nem ellenőrizte ezt. Ez hasznos egy
    "persona" típusú ellenőrzéshez, mikor Ön egy pszeudonim felhasználó
    kulcsát írja alá.

"2" azt jelenti, hogy Ön a kulcsot hétköznapi alapossággal ellenőrizte.
    Például ez azt jelentheti, hogy ellenőrizte a kulcs ujjlenyomatát, és
    összevetette a kulcson szereplő felhasználóazonosítót egy fényképes
    igazolvánnyal.

"3" azt jelenti, hogy alaposan ellenőrizte a kulcsot. Például ez azt
    jelentheti, hogy a kulcs ujjlenyomatát a tulajdonossal személyesen
    találkozva ellenőrizte, egy nehezen hamisítható, fényképes igazolvánnyal
    (mint az útlevél) meggyőződött arról, hogy a személy neve egyezik a
    kulcson levővel, és végül (e-mail váltással) ellenőrizte, hogy a kulcson
    szereplő e-mail cím a kulcs tulajdonosához tartozik.

A 2-es és 3-as szintekhez adott példák *csak* példák. Végső soron Ön dönti
el, hogy mit jelentenek Önnek a "hétköznapi" és "alapos" kifejezések,
amikor mások kulcsát aláírja.

Ha nem tudja, hogy mit válaszoljon, írjon "0"-t!
.

.gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
Kérem, adjon "igen" vagy "nem" választ!
.

.gpg.keyedit.save.okay
Kérem, adjon "igen" vagy "nem" választ!
.

.gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
Kérem, adjon "igen" vagy "nem" választ!
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
Válaszoljon "igen"-nel, ha valóban törölni akarja ezt a felhasználóazonosítót!
Minden igazolás törlődik vele együtt!
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
Válaszoljon "igen"-nel, ha az alkulcs törölhető.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
Ez egy érvényes aláírás a kulcson. Normál esetben nincs értelme
törölni, mert fontos lehet ahhoz, hogy érvényesítse ezt a kulcsot,
vagy egy másikat, melyet ezzel a kulccsal igazolnak.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
Ezt az aláírást nem tudom ellenőrizni, mert nincs meg a hozzá tartozó
kulcs. Ajánlatos lenne elhalasztani a törlést addig, amíg meg nem tudja,
hogy melyik kulcsot használták, mert ez az aláíró kulcs bizalmi
kapcsolatot hozhat létre egy már hitelesített kulcson keresztül.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
Ez az aláírás nem érvényes. Értelmetlen eltávolítani a kulcskarikáról.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
Ez egy olyan aláírás, amely összeköti a felhasználóazonosítót
a kulccsal. Általában nem jó ötlet egy ilyen aláírást eltávolítani.
Az is lehetséges, hogy a GnuPG többé nem tudja használni ezt
a kulcsot. Csak akkor tegye ezt, ha valami okból ez az önaláírás nem
érvényes, és rendelkezésre áll egy másik!
.

.gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay

      illetéktelen kezekbe került!
  "A kulcsot lecserélték."
      Használja ezt akkor, ha a kulcsot lecserélte egy újabbra!
  "A kulcs már nem használatos."
      Használja ezt akkor, ha már nem használja a kulcsot!
  "A felhasználóazonosító már nem érvényes."
      Használja ezt akkor, ha azt állítja, hogy a felhasználóazonosító
      már nem használatos! Általában érvénytelen e-mail címet jelent.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.value
Terserah anda untuk memberi nilai baru di sini; nilai ini tidak akan diekspor
ke pihak ketiga. Kami perlu untuk mengimplementasikan web-of-trust; tidak ada
kaitan dengan (membuat secara implisit) web-of-certificates.
.

.gpg.edit_ownertrust.set_ultimate.okay
Untuk membuat Web-of-Trust, GnuPG perlu tahu kunci mana yang
sangat dipercaya - mereka biasanya adalah kunci yang anda punya
akses ke kunci rahasia.  Jawab "yes" untuk menset kunci ini ke
sangat dipercaya

.

.gpg.untrusted_key.override
Jika anda ingin menggunakan kunci tidak terpercaya ini, jawab "ya".
.

.gpg.pklist.user_id.enter
Masukkan ID user penerima pesan.
.

.#gpg.keygen.algo
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Select the algorithm to use.

DSA (aka DSS) is the Digital Signature Algorithm and can only be used
for signatures.

Elgamal is an encrypt-only algorithm.

RSA may be used for signatures or encryption.

The first (primary) key must always be a key which is capable of signing.
.

.gpg.keygen.algo.rsa_se
Secara umum bukan ide baik untuk menggunakan kunci yang sama untuk menandai dan
mengenkripsi.  Algoritma ini seharusnya digunakan dalam domain tertentu.
Silakan berkonsultasi dulu dengan ahli keamanan anda.
.

.gpg.keygen.size
Masukkan ukuran kunci
.

.gpg.keygen.size.huge.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.gpg.keygen.size.large.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.gpg.keygen.valid
Masukkan nilai yang diperlukan seperti pada prompt.
Dapat digunakan format (YYYY-MM-DD) untuk mengisi tanggal ISO tetapi anda
tidak akan mendapat respon kesalahan yang baik - sebaiknya sistem akan
berusaha menginterprestasi nilai yang diberikan sebagai sebuah interval.
.

.gpg.keygen.valid.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.gpg.keygen.name
Masukkan nama pemegang kunci
.

.gpg.keygen.email
silakan masukkan alamat email (pilihan namun sangat dianjurkan)
.

.gpg.keygen.comment
Silakan masukkan komentar tambahan
.

.gpg.keygen.userid.cmd
N  untuk merubah nama.
K  untuk merubah komentar.
E  untuk merubah alamat email.
O  untuk melanjutkan dengan pembuatan kunci.
K  untuk menghentikan pembuatan kunci.
.

.gpg.keygen.sub.okay
Jawab "ya" (atau "y") jika telah siap membuat subkey.
.

.gpg.sign_uid.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.gpg.sign_uid.class
Ketika anda menandai user ID pada kunci, anda perlu memverifikasi bahwa kunci
milik orang yang disebut dalam user ID.  Ini penting bagi orang lain untuk tahu
seberapa cermat anda memverifikasi ini.

"0" berarti anda tidak melakukan klaim tentang betapa cermat anda memverifikasi    kunci.

"1" berarti anda percaya bahwa kunci dimiliki oleh orang yang mengklaim memilikinya
    namun anda tidak dapat, atau tidak memverifikasi kunci sama sekali.  Hal ini bergunabagi
    verifikasi "persona", yaitu anda menandai kunci user pseudonymous

"2" berarti anda melakukan verifikasi kasual atas kunci.  Sebagai contoh, halini dapat
    berarti bahwa anda memverifikasi fingerprint kunci dan memeriksa user ID pada kunci
    dengan photo ID.

"3" berarti anda melakukan verifikasi ekstensif atas kunci.  Sebagai contoh, hal ini
    dapat berarti anda memverifikasi fingerprint kunci dengan pemilik kunci
    secara personal, dan anda memeriksa, dengan menggunakan dokumen yang sulit dipalsukan yang memiliki
    photo ID (seperti paspor) bahwa nama pemilik kunci cocok dengan
    nama user ID kunci, dan bahwa anda telah memverifikasi (dengan pertukaran
    email) bahwa alamat email pada kunci milik pemilik kunci.

Contoh-contoh pada level 2 dan 3 hanyalah contoh.
Pada akhirnya, terserah anda untuk memutuskan apa arti  "kasual" dan "ekstensif"
bagi anda ketika menandai kunci lain.

Jika anda tidak tahu jawaban yang tepat, jawab "0".
.

.gpg.change_passwd.empty.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.gpg.keyedit.save.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.gpg.keyedit.cancel.okay
Jawab "ya" atau "tidak"
.

.#gpg.keyedit.sign_all.okay
# fixme: Please translate and remove the hash mark from the key line.
Answer "yes" if you want to sign ALL the user IDs
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.uid.okay
Jawab "ya" jika anda benar-benar ingin menghapus ID user ini.
Seluruh sertifikat juga akan hilang!
.

.gpg.keyedit.remove.subkey.okay
Jawab "ya" jika ingin menghapus subkey
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.valid
Ini adalah signature valid untuk kunci; anda normalnya tdk ingin menghapus
signature ini karena mungkin penting membangun koneksi trust ke kunci atau
ke kunci tersertifikasi lain dengan kunci ini.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.unknown
Signature ini tidak dapat diperiksa karena anda tidak memiliki kunci
korespondennya. Anda perlu menunda penghapusannya hingga anda tahu
kunci yang digunakan karena kunci penanda ini mungkin membangun suatu
koneksi trust melalui kunci yang telah tersertifikasi lain.
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.invalid
Signature tidak valid.  Adalah hal yang masuk akal untuk menghapusnya dari
keyring anda
.

.gpg.keyedit.delsig.selfsig
Ini adalah signature yang menghubungkan ID pemakai ke kunci. Biasanya
bukan ide yang baik untuk menghapus signature semacam itu. Umumnya
GnuPG tidak akan dapat menggunakan kunci ini lagi. Sehingga lakukan hal
ini bila self-signature untuk beberapa alasan tidak valid dan
tersedia yang kedua.
.

.gpg.keyedit.updpref.okay
Rubah preferensi seluruh user ID (atau hanya yang terpilih)
ke daftar preferensi saat ini.  Timestamp seluruh self-signature
yang terpengaruh akan bertambah satu detik.

.

.gpg.passphrase.enter
Silakan masukkan passphrase; ini kalimat rahasia

.

.gpg.passphrase.repeat
Silakan ulangi passphrase terakhir, sehingga anda yakin yang anda ketikkan.
.

.gpg.detached_signature.filename
Beri nama file tempat berlakunya signature
.

.gpg.openfile.overwrite.okay
Jawab "ya" jika tidak apa-apa menimpa file
.

.gpg.openfile.askoutname
Silakan masukan nama file baru. Jika anda hanya menekan RETURN nama
file baku (yang diapit tanda kurung) akan dipakai.
.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.code
Anda harus menspesifikasikan alasan pembatalan. Semua ini tergantung
konteks, anda dapat memilih dari daftar berikut:
 "Key has been compromised"
      Gunakan ini jika anda punya alasan untuk percaya bahwa orang yang tidak berhak
      memiliki akses ke kunci pribadi anda.
  "Key is superseded"
      Gunakan ini bila anda mengganti kunci anda dengan yang baru.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Gunakan ini bila anda telah mempensiunkan kunci ini.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Gunakan ini untuk menyatakan user ID tidak boleh digunakan lagi;
      normalnya digunakan untuk menandai bahwa alamat email tidak valid lagi.

.

.gpg.ask_revocation_reason.text
Jika anda suka, anda dapat memasukkan teks menjelaskan mengapa anda
mengeluarkan sertifikat pembatalan ini. Buatlah ringkas.
Baris kosong mengakhiri teks.
