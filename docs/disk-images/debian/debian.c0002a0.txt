 PCRE LICENCE
 ------------
 .
 PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

 .
 1. This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .
 2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by
    explicit claim or by omission. In practice, this means that if you use
    PCRE in software that you distribute to others, commercially or
    otherwise, you must put a sentence like this
 .
      Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
      which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
      by the University of Cambridge, England.

    somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant
    files or online help data or similar. A reference to the ftp site for
    the source, that is, to

 .
    should also be given in the documentation. However, this condition is not
    intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
    it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
    A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
    independently).

 3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
    misrepresented as being the original software.

 4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU

   then the terms of that licence shall supersede any condition above with

 The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed
