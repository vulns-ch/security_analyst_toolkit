Mike Haertel wrote the main program and the dfa and kwset matchers.

Isamu Hasegawa wrote the POSIX regular expression matcher, which is
part of the GNU C Library and is distributed as part of GNU grep for
use on non-GNU systems.  Ulrich Drepper, Paul Eggert, Paolo Bonzini,
Stanislav Brabec, Assaf Gordon, Jakub Jelinek, Jim Meyering, Arnold
Robbins, Andreas Schwab and Florian Weimer also contributed to this
matcher.

Arthur David Olson contributed the heuristics for finding fixed substrings
at the end of dfa.c.

Henry Spencer wrote the original test suite from which grep's was derived.
Scott Anderson invented the Khadafy test.

David MacKenzie wrote the automatic configuration software used to
produce the configure script.

Authors of the replacements for standard library routines are identified
in the corresponding source files.

The idea of using Boyer-Moore type algorithms to quickly filter out
non-matching text before calling the regexp matcher was originally due
to James Woods.  He also contributed some code to early versions of
GNU grep.

Mike Haertel would like to thank Andrew Hume for many fascinating
discussions of string searching issues over the years.  Hume and
Sunday's excellent paper on fast string searching describes some of
the history of the subject, as well as providing exhaustive
performance analysis of various implementation alternatives.
The inner loop of GNU grep is similar to Hume & Sunday's recommended
"Tuned Boyer Moore" inner loop (see the Hume & Sunday citation in
the grep manual's "Performance" chapter).

Arnold Robbins contributed to improve dfa.[ch]. In fact
it came straight from gawk-3.0.3 with small editing and fixes.

Norihiro Tanaka contributed many performance improvements and other
fixes, particularly to multi-byte matchers.

Paul Eggert contributed support for recursive grep, as well as several
performance improvements such as searching file holes efficiently.

Many other folks contributed.  See THANKS; if someone is omitted
please file a bug report.

Alain Magloire maintained GNU grep until version 2.5e.

Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkr√§nzer <bero@arklinux.org> maintained GNU grep until
version 2.5.1, ie. from Sep 2001 till 2003.

Stepan Kasal <kasal@ucw.cz> maintained GNU grep since Feb 2004.

Tony Abou-Assaleh <taa@acm.org> maintains GNU grep since Oct 2007.

Jim Meyering <jim@meyering.net> and Paolo Bonzini <bonzini@gnu.org>
began maintaining GNU grep in Nov 2009.  Paolo bowed out in 2012.

This is GNU grep, the "fastest grep in the west" (we hope).  All
bugs reported in previous releases have been fixed.  Many exciting new
bugs have probably been introduced in this revision.

GNU grep is provided "as is" with no warranty.  The exact terms
under which you may use and (re)distribute this program are detailed
in the GNU General Public License, in the file COPYING.

GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher
hybridized with Boyer-Moore and Aho-Corasick searches for fixed
strings that eliminate impossible text from being considered by the
full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every
character.  The result is typically many times faster than traditional
implementations.  (Regular expressions containing back-references will
run more slowly, however.)

See the files AUTHORS and THANKS for a list of authors and other contributors.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
If there is no INSTALL file, this copy of the source code is intended
for expert hackers; please see the file README-hacking.

See the file NEWS for a description of major changes in this release.

See the file TODO for ideas on how you could help us improve grep.

See the file README-alpha for information on grep development and the CVS
  repository.

KNOWN BUGS:

Several tests in fmbtest.sh and foad1.sh fail under the cs_CZ.UTF-8 locale
and have been disabled.

The combination of -o and -i options is broken and the known failing cases
are disabled in foad1.sh

The option -i does not work properly in some multibyte locales such as
tr_TR.UTF-8 where the upper case and lower case forms of a character are not
necessarily of the same byte length.
