er" or "**identifier". (As a special
case, parameters of the form "*identifier" may have an annotation “":
*expression"”.) Functions may have “return” annotation of the form
“"-> expression"” after the parameter list.  These annotations can be
any valid Python expression.  The presence of annotations does not
change the semantics of a function.  The annotation values are
available as values of a dictionary keyed by the parameters’ names in
the "__annotations__" attribute of the function object.  If the
"annotations" import from "__future__" is used, annotations are
preserved as strings at runtime which enables postponed evaluation.
Otherwise, they are evaluated when the function definition is
executed.  In this case annotations may be evaluated in a different
order than they appear in the source code.

Changed in version 3.11: Parameters of the form “"*identifier"” may
have an annotation “": *expression"”. See **PEP 646**.

It is also possible to create anonymous functions (functions not bound
to a name), for immediate use in expressions.  This uses lambda
expressions, described in section Lambdas.  Note that the lambda
expression is merely a shorthand for a simplified function definition;
a function defined in a “"def"” statement can be passed around or
assigned to another name just like a function defined by a lambda
expression.  The “"def"” form is actually more powerful since it
allows the execution of multiple statements and annotations.

**Programmer’s note:** Functions are first-class objects.  A “"def"”
statement executed inside a function definition defines a local
function that can be returned or passed around.  Free variables used
in the nested function can access the local variables of the function
containing the def.  See section Naming and binding for details.

    'global': r'''The "global" statement
**********************

   global_stmt ::= "global" identifier ("," identifier)*

The "global" statement causes the listed identifiers to be interpreted
as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable
without "global", although free variables may refer to globals without
being declared global.

The "global" statement applies to the entire scope of a function or
class body. A "SyntaxError" is raised if a variable is used or
assigned to prior to its global declaration in the scope.

**Programmer’s note:** "global" is a directive to the parser.  It
applies only to code parsed at the same time as the "global"
statement. In particular, a "global" statement contained in a string
or code object supplied to the built-in "exec()" function does not
affect the code block *containing* the function call, and code
contained in such a string is unaffected by "global" statements in the
code containing the function call.  The same applies to the "eval()"
and "compile()" functions.
''',
    'id-classes': r'''Reserved classes of identifiers
*******************************

Certain classes of identifiers (besides keywords) have special
meanings.  These classes are identified by the patterns of leading and
trailing underscore characters:

"_*"
   Not imported by "from module import *".

"_"
   In a "case" pattern within a "match" statement, "_" is a soft
   keyword that denotes a wildcard.

   Separately, the interactive interpreter makes the result of the
   last evaluation available in the variable "_". (It is stored in the
   "builtins" module, alongside built-in functions like "print".)

   Elsewhere, "_" is a regular identifier. It is often used to name
   “special” items, but it is not special to Python itself.

   Note:

     The name "_" is often used in conjunction with
     internationalization; refer to the documentation for the
     "gettext" module for more information on this convention.It is
     also commonly used for unused variables.

"__*__"
   System-defined names, informally known as “dunder” names. These
   names are defined by the interpreter and its implementation
   (including the standard library). Current system names are
   discussed in the Special method names section and elsewhere. More
   will likely be defined in future versions of Python.  *Any* use of
   "__*__" names, in any context, that does not follow explicitly
   documented use, is subject to breakage without warning.

"__*"
   Class-private names.  Names in this category, when used within the
   context of a class definition, are re-written to use a mangled form
   to help avoid name clashes between “private” attributes of base and
   derived classes. See section Identifiers (Names).
''',
    'identifiers': r'''Identifiers and keywords
************************

Identifiers (also referred to as *names*) are described by the
following lexical definitions.

The syntax of identifiers in Python is based on the Unicode standard
annex UAX-31, with elaboration and changes as defined below; see also
**PEP 3131** for further details.

Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F), the valid characters for
identifiers include the uppercase and lowercase letters "A" through
"Z", the underscore "_" and, except for the first character, the
digits "0" through "9". Python 3.0 introduced additional characters
from outside the ASCII range (see **PEP 3131**).  For these
characters, the classification uses the version of the Unicode
Character Database as included in the "unicodedata" module.

Identifiers are unlimited in length.  Case is significant.

   identifier   ::= xid_start xid_continue*
   id_start     ::= <all characters in general categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Nl, the underscore, and characters with the Other_ID_Start property>
   id_continue  ::= <all characters in id_start, plus characters in the categories Mn, Mc, Nd, Pc and others with the Other_ID_Continue property>
   xid_start    ::= <all characters in id_start whose NFKC normalization is in "id_start xid_continue*">
   xid_continue ::= <all characters in id_continue whose NFKC normalization is in "id_continue*">

The Unicode category codes mentioned above stand for:

* *Lu* - uppercase letters

* *Ll* - lowercase letters

* *Lt* - titlecase letters

* *Lm* - modifier letters

* *Lo* - other letters

* *Nl* - letter numbers

* *Mn* - nonspacing marks

* *Mc* - spacing combining marks

* *Nd* - decimal numbers

* *Pc* - connector punctuations

* *Other_ID_Start* - explicit list of characters in PropList.txt to
  support backwards compatibility

* *Other_ID_Continue* - likewise

All identifiers are converted into the normal form NFKC while parsing;
comparison of identifiers is based on NFKC.

A non-normative HTML file listing all valid identifier characters for
Unicode 15.1.0 can be found at
https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.1.0/ucd/DerivedCoreProperties.txt


Keywords
========

The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or *keywords* of
the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.  They must
be spelled exactly as written here:

   False      await      else       import     pass
   None       break      except     in         raise
   True       class      finally    is         return
   and        continue   for        lambda     try
   as         def        from       nonlocal   while
   assert     del        global     not        with
   async      elif       if         or         yield


Soft Keywords
=============

Added in version 3.10.

Some identifiers are only reserved under specific contexts. These are
known as *soft keywords*.  The identifiers "match", "case", "type" and
"_" can syntactically act as keywords in certain contexts, but this
distinction is done at the parser level, not when tokenizing.

As soft keywords, their use in the grammar is possible while still
preserving compatibility with existing code that uses these names as
identifier names.

"match", "case", and "_" are used in the "match" statement. "type" is
used in the "type" statement.

Changed in version 3.12: "type" is now a soft keyword.


Reserved classes of identifiers
===============================

Certain classes of identifiers (besides keywords) have special
meanings.  These classes are identified by the patterns of leading and
trailing underscore characters:

"_*"
   Not imported by "from module import *".

"_"
   In a "case" pattern within a "match" statement, "_" is a soft
   keyword that denotes a wildcard.

   Separately, the interactive interpreter makes the result of the
   last evaluation available in the variable "_". (It is stored in the
   "builtins" module, alongside built-in functions like "print".)

   Elsewhere, "_" is a regular identifier. It is often used to name
   “special” items, but it is not special to Python itself.

   Note:

     The name "_" is often used in conjunction with
     internationalization; refer to the documentation for the
     "gettext" module for more information on this convention.It is
     also commonly used for unused variables.

"__*__"
   System-defined names, informally known as “dunder” names. These
   names are defined by the interpreter and its implementation
   (including the standard library). Current system names are
   discussed in the Special method names section and elsewhere. More
   will likely be defined in future versions of Python.  *Any* use of
   "__*__" names, in any context, that does not follow explicitly
   documented use, is subject to breakage without warning.

"__*"
   Class-private names.  Names in this category, when used within the
   context of a class definition, are re-written to use a mangled form
   to help avoid name clashes between “private” attributes of base and
   derived classes. See section Identifiers (Names).
''',
    'if': r'''The "if" statement
******************

The "if" statement is used for conditional execution:

   if_stmt ::= "if" assignment_expression ":" suite
               ("elif" assignment_expression ":" suite)*
               ["else" ":" suite]

It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one
by one until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations
for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed
(and no other part of the "if" statement is executed or evaluated).
If all expressions are false, the suite of the "else" clause, if
present, is executed.
''',
    'imaginary': r'''Imaginary literals
******************

Imaginary literals are described by the following lexical definitions:

   imagnumber ::= (floatnumber | digitpart) ("j" | "J")

An imaginary literal yields a complex number with a real part of 0.0.
Complex numbers are represented as a pair of floating-point numbers
and have the same restrictions on their range.  To create a complex
number with a nonzero real part, add a floating-point number to it,
e.g., "(3+4j)".  Some examples of imaginary literals:

   3.14j   10.j    10j     .001j   1e100j   3.14e-10j   3.14_15_93j
''',
    'import': r'''The "import" statement
**********************

   import_stmt     ::= "import" module ["as" identifier] ("," module ["as" identifier])*
                       | "from" relative_module "import" identifier ["as" identifier]
                       ("," identifier ["as" identifier])*
                       | "from" relative_module "import" "(" identifier ["as" identifier]
                       ("," identifier ["as" identifier])* [","] ")"
                       | "from" relative_module "import" "*"
   module          ::= (identifier ".")* identifier
   relative_module ::= "."* module | "."+

The basic import statement (no "from" clause) is executed in two
steps:

1. find a module, loading and initializing it if necessary

2. define a name or names in the local namespace for the scope where
   the "import" statement occurs.

When the statement contains multiple clauses (separated by commas) the
two steps are carried out separately for each clause, just as though
the clauses had been separated out into individual import statements.

The details of the first step, finding and loading modules, are
described in greater detail in the section on the import system, which
also describes the various types of packages and modules that can be
imported, as well as all the hooks that can be used to customize the
import system. Note that failures in this step may indicate either
that the module could not be located, *or* that an error occurred
while initializing the module, which includes execution of the
module’s code.

If the requested module is retrieved successfully, it will be made
available in the local namespace in one of three ways:

* If the module name is followed by "as", then the name following "as"
  is bound directly to the imported module.

* If no other name is specified, and the module being imported is a
  top level module, the module’s name is bound in the local namespace
  as a reference to the imported module

* If the module being imported is *not* a top level module, then the
  name of the top level package that contains the module is bound in
  the local namespace as a reference to the top level package. The
  imported module must be accessed using its full qualified name
  rather than directly

The "from" form uses a slightly more complex process:

1. find the module specified in the "from" clause, loading and
   initializing it if necessary;

2. for each of the identifiers specified in the "import" clauses:

   1. check if the imported module has an attribute by that name

   2. if not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then
      check the imported module again for that attribute

   3. if the attribute is not found, "ImportError" is raised.

   4. otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local
      namespace, using the name in the "as" clause if it is present,
      otherwise using the attribute name

Examples:

   import foo                 # foo imported and bound locally
   import foo.bar.baz         # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo bound locally
   import foo.bar.baz as fbb  # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo.bar.baz bound as fbb
   from foo.bar import baz    # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo.bar.baz bound as baz
   from foo import attr       # foo imported and foo.attr bound as attr

If the list of identifiers is replaced by a star ("'*'"), all public
names defined in the module are bound in the local namespace for the
scope where the "import" statement occurs.

The *public names* defined by a module are determined by checking the
module’s namespace for a variable named "__all__"; if defined, it must
be a sequence of strings which are names defined or imported by that
module.  The names given in "__all__" are all considered public and
are required to exist.  If "__all__" is not defined, the set of public
names includes all names found in the module’s namespace which do not
begin with an underscore character ("'_'").  "__all__" should contain
the entire public API. It is intended to avoid accidentally exporting
items that are not part of the API (such as library modules which were
imported and used within the module).

The wild card form of import — "from module import *" — is only
allowed at the module level.  Attempting to use it in class or
function definitions will raise a "SyntaxError".

When specifying what module to import you do not have to specify the
absolute name of the module. When a module or package is contained
within another package it is possible to make a relative import within
the same top package without having to mention the package name. By
using leading dots in the specified module or package after "from" you
can specify how high to traverse up the current package hierarchy
without specifying exact names. One leading dot means the current
package where the module making the import exists. Two dots means up
one package level. Three dots is up two levels, etc. So if you execute
"from . import mod" from a module in the "pkg" package then you will
end up importing "pkg.mod". If you execute "from ..subpkg2 import mod"
from within "pkg.subpkg1" you will import "pkg.subpkg2.mod". The
specification for relative imports is contained in the Package
Relative Imports section.

"importlib.import_module()" is provided to support applications that
determine dynamically the modules to be loaded.

Raises an auditing event "import" with arguments "module", "filename",
"sys.path", "sys.meta_path", "sys.path_hooks".


Future statements
=================

A *future statement* is a directive to the compiler that a particular
module should be compiled using syntax or semantics that will be
available in a specified future release of Python where the feature
becomes standard.

The future statement is intended to ease migration to future versions
of Python that introduce incompatible changes to the language.  It
allows use of the new features on a per-module basis before the
release in which the feature becomes standard.

   future_stmt ::= "from" "__future__" "import" feature ["as" identifier]
                   ("," feature ["as" identifier])*
                   | "from" "__future__" "import" "(" feature ["as" identifier]
                   ("," feature ["as" identifier])* [","] ")"
   feature     ::= identifier

A future statement must appear near the top of the module.  The only
lines that can appear before a future statement are:

* the module docstring (if any),

* comments,

* blank lines, and

* other future statements.

The only feature that requires using the future statement is
"annotations" (see **PEP 563**).

All historical features enabled by the future statement are still
recognized by Python 3.  The list includes "absolute_import",
"division", "generators", "generator_stop", "unicode_literals",
"print_function", "nested_scopes" and "with_statement".  They are all
redundant because they are always enabled, and only kept for backwards
compatibility.

A future statement is recognized and treated specially at compile
time: Changes to the semantics of core constructs are often
implemented by generating different code.  It may even be the case
that a new feature introduces new incompatible syntax (such as a new
reserved word), in which case the compiler may need to parse the
module differently.  Such decisions cannot be pushed off until
runtime.

For any given release, the compiler knows which feature names have
been defined, and raises a compile-time error if a future statement
contains a feature not known to it.

The direct runtime semantics are the same as for any import statement:
there is a standard module "__future__", described later, and it will
be imported in the usual way at the time the future statement is
executed.

The interesting runtime semantics depend on the specific feature
enabled by the future statement.

Note that there is nothing special about the statement:

   import __future__ [as name]

That is not a future statement; it’s an ordinary import statement with
no special semantics or syntax restrictions.

Code compiled by calls to the built-in functions "exec()" and
"compile()" that occur in a module "M" containing a future statement
will, by default, use the new syntax or semantics associated with the
future statement.  This can be controlled by optional arguments to
"compile()" — see the documentation of that function for details.

A future statement typed at an interactive interpreter prompt will
take effect for the rest of the interpreter session.  If an
interpreter is started with the "-i" option, is passed a script name
to execute, and the script includes a future statement, it will be in
effect in the interactive session started after the script is
executed.

''',
    'in': r'''Membership test operations
**************************

The operators "in" and "not in" test for membership.  "x in s"
evaluates to "True" if *x* is a member of *s*, and "False" otherwise.
"x not in s" returns the negation of "x in s".  All built-in sequences
and set types support this as well as dictionary, for which "in" tests
whether the dictionary has a given key. For container types such as
list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the
expression "x in y" is equivalent to "any(x is e or x == e for e in
y)".

For the string and bytes types, "x in y" is "True" if and only if *x*
is a substring of *y*.  An equivalent test is "y.find(x) != -1".
Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other
string, so """ in "abc"" will return "True".

For user-defined classes which define the "__contains__()" method, "x
in y" returns "True" if "y.__contains__(x)" returns a true value, and
"False" otherwise.

For user-defined classes which do not define "__contains__()" but do
define "__iter__()", "x in y" is "True" if some value "z", for which
the expression "x is z or x == z" is true, is produced while iterating
over "y". If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if
"in" raised that exception.

Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines
"__getitem__()", "x in y" is "True" if and only if there is a non-
negative integer index *i* such that "x is y[i] or x == y[i]", and no
lower integer index raises the "IndexError" exception.  (If any other
exception is raised, it is as if "in" raised that exception).

The operator "not in" is defined to have the inverse truth value of
"in".

    'integers': r'''Integer literals
****************

Integer literals are described by the following lexical definitions:

   integer      ::= decinteger | bininteger | octinteger | hexinteger
   decinteger   ::= nonzerodigit (["_"] digit)* | "0"+ (["_"] "0")*
   bininteger   ::= "0" ("b" | "B") (["_"] bindigit)+
   octinteger   ::= "0" ("o" | "O") (["_"] octdigit)+
   hexinteger   ::= "0" ("x" | "X") (["_"] hexdigit)+
   nonzerodigit ::= "1"..."9"
   digit        ::= "0"..."9"
   bindigit     ::= "0" | "1"
   octdigit     ::= "0"..."7"
   hexdigit     ::= digit | "a"..."f" | "A"..."F"

There is no limit for the length of integer literals apart from what
can be stored in available memory.

Underscores are ignored for determining the numeric value of the
literal.  They can be used to group digits for enhanced readability.
One underscore can occur between digits, and after base specifiers
like "0x".

Note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed.
This is for disambiguation with C-style octal literals, which Python
used before version 3.0.

Some examples of integer literals:

   7     2147483647                        0o177    0b100110111

purposes in literals.

''',
    'naming': r'''Naming and binding
******************


Binding of names
================

*Names* refer to objects.  Names are introduced by name binding
operations.

The following constructs bind names:

* formal parameters to functions,

* class definitions,

* function definitions,

* assignment expressions,

* targets that are identifiers if occurring in an assignment:

  * "for" loop header,

  * after "as" in a "with" statement, "except" clause, "except*"
    clause, or in the as-pattern in structural pattern matching,

  * in a capture pattern in structural pattern matching

* "import" statements.

* "type" statements.

* type parameter lists.

The "import" statement of the form "from ... import *" binds all names
defined in the imported module, except those beginning with an
underscore. This form may only be used at the module level.

A target occurring in a "del" statement is also considered bound for
this purpose (though the actual semantics are to unbind the name).

Each assignment or import statement occurs within a block defined by a
class or function definition or at the module level (the top-level
code block).

If a name is bound in a block, it is a local variable of that block,
unless declared as "nonlocal" or "global".  If a name is bound at the
module level, it is a global variable.  (The variables of the module
code block are local and global.)  If a variable is used in a code
block but not defined there, it is a *free variable*.

Each occurrence of a name in the program text refers to the *binding*
of that name established by the following name resolution rules.


Resolution of names
===================

A *scope* defines the visibility of a name within a block.  If a local
variable is defined in a block, its scope includes that block.  If the
definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks
contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces
a different binding for the name.

When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest
enclosing scope.  The set of all such scopes visible to a code block
is called the block’s *environment*.

When a name is not found at all, a "NameError" exception is raised. If
the current scope is a function scope, and the name refers to a local
variable that has not yet been bound to a value at the point where the
name is used, an "UnboundLocalError" exception is raised.
"UnboundLocalError" is a subclass of "NameError".

If a name binding operation occurs anywhere within a code block, all
uses of the name within the block are treated as references to the
current block.  This can lead to errors when a name is used within a
block before it is bound.  This rule is subtle.  Python lacks
declarations and allows name binding operations to occur anywhere
within a code block.  The local variables of a code block can be
determined by scanning the entire text of the block for name binding
operations. See the FAQ entry on UnboundLocalError for examples.

If the "global" statement occurs within a block, all uses of the names
specified in the statement refer to the bindings of those names in the
top-level namespace.  Names are resolved in the top-level namespace by
searching the global namespace, i.e. the namespace of the module
containing the code block, and the builtins namespace, the namespace
of the module "builtins".  The global namespace is searched first.  If
the names are not found there, the builtins namespace is searched
next. If the names are also not found in the builtins namespace, new
variables are created in the global namespace. The global statement
must precede all uses of the listed names.

The "global" statement has the same scope as a name binding operation
in the same block.  If the nearest enclosing scope for a free variable
contains a global statement, the free variable is treated as a global.

The "nonlocal" statement causes corresponding names to refer to
previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing function scope.
"SyntaxError" is raised at compile time if the given name does not
exist in any enclosing function scope. Type parameters cannot be
rebound with the "nonlocal" statement.

The namespace for a module is automatically created the first time a
module is imported.  The main module for a script is always called
"__main__".

Class definition blocks and arguments to "exec()" and "eval()" are
special in the context of name resolution. A class definition is an
executable statement that may use and define names. These references
follow the normal rules for name resolution with an exception that
unbound local variables are looked up in the global namespace. The
namespace of the class definition becomes the attribute dictionary of
the class. The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to
the class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods.
This includes comprehensions and generator expressions, but it does
not include annotation scopes, which have access to their enclosing
class scopes. This means that the following will fail:

   class A:
       a = 42
       b = list(a + i for i in range(10))

However, the following will succeed:

   class A:
       type Alias = Nested
       class Nested: pass

   print(A.Alias.__value__)  # <type 'A.Nested'>


Annotation scopes
=================

Type parameter lists and "type" statements introduce *annotation
scopes*, which behave mostly like function scopes, but with some
exceptions discussed below. *Annotations* currently do not use
annotation scopes, but they are expected to use annotation scopes in
Python 3.13 when **PEP 649** is implemented.

Annotation scopes are used in the following contexts:

* Type parameter lists for generic type aliases.

* Type parameter lists for generic functions. A generic function’s
  annotations are executed within the annotation scope, but its
  defaults and decorators are not.

* Type parameter lists for generic classes. A generic class’s base
  classes and keyword arguments are executed within the annotation
  scope, but its decorators are not.

* The bounds, constraints, and default values for type parameters
  (lazily evaluated).

* The value of type aliases (lazily evaluated).

Annotation scopes differ from function scopes in the following ways:

* Annotation scopes have access to their enclosing class namespace. If
  an annotation scope is immediately within a class scope, or within
  another annotation scope that is immediately within a class scope,
  the code in the annotation scope can use names defined in the class
  scope as if it were executed directly within the class body. This
  contrasts with regular functions defined within classes, which
  cannot access names defined in the class scope.

* Expressions in annotation scopes cannot contain "yield", "yield
  from", "await", or ":=" expressions. (These expressions are allowed
  in other scopes contained within the annotation scope.)

* Names defined in annotation scopes cannot be rebound with "nonlocal"
  statements in inner scopes. This includes only type parameters, as
  no other syntactic elements that can appear within annotation scopes
  can introduce new names.

* While annotation scopes have an internal name, that name is not
  reflected in the *qualified name* of objects defined within the
  scope. Instead, the "__qualname__" of such objects is as if the
  object were defined in the enclosing scope.

Added in version 3.12: Annotation scopes were introduced in Python
3.12 as part of **PEP 695**.

Changed in version 3.13: Annotation scopes are also used for type
parameter defaults, as introduced by **PEP 696**.


Lazy evaluation
===============

The values of type aliases created through the "type" statement are
*lazily evaluated*. The same applies to the bounds, constraints, and
default values of type variables created through the type parameter
syntax. This means that they are not evaluated when the type alias or
type variable is created. Instead, they are only evaluated when doing
so is necessary to resolve an attribute access.

Example:

   >>> type Alias = 1/0
   >>> Alias.__value__
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
   >>> def func[T: 1/0](): pass
   >>> T = func.__type_params__[0]
   >>> T.__bound__
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Here the exception is raised only when the "__value__" attribute of
the type alias or the "__bound__" attribute of the type variable is
accessed.

This behavior is primarily useful for references to types that have
not yet been defined when the type alias or type variable is created.
For example, lazy evaluation enables creation of mutually recursive
type aliases:

   from typing import Literal

   type SimpleExpr = int | Parenthesized
   type Parenthesized = tuple[Literal["("], Expr, Literal[")"]]
   type Expr = SimpleExpr | tuple[SimpleExpr, Literal["+", "-"], Expr]

Lazily evaluated values are evaluated in annotation scope, which means
that names that appear inside the lazily evaluated value are looked up
as if they were used in the immediately enclosing scope.

Added in version 3.12.


Builtins and restricted execution
=================================

**CPython implementation detail:** Users should not touch
"__builtins__"; it is strictly an implementation detail.  Users
wanting to override values in the builtins namespace should "import"
the "builtins" module and modify its attributes appropriately.

The builtins namespace associated with the execution of a code block
is actually found by looking up the name "__builtins__" in its global
namespace; this should be a dictionary or a module (in the latter case
the module’s dictionary is used).  By default, when in the "__main__"
module, "__builtins__" is the built-in module "builtins"; when in any
other module, "__builtins__" is an alias for the dictionary of the
"builtins" module itself.


Interaction with dynamic features
=================================

Name resolution of free variables occurs at runtime, not at compile
time. This means that the following code will print 42:

   i = 10
   def f():
       print(i)
   i = 42
   f()

The "eval()" and "exec()" functions do not have access to the full
environment for resolving names.  Names may be resolved in the local
and global namespaces of the caller.  Free variables are not resolved
in the nearest enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace.  [1]
The "exec()" and "eval()" functions have optional arguments to
override the global and local namespace.  If only one namespace is
specified, it is used for both.
''',
    'nonlocal': r'''The "nonlocal" statement
************************

   nonlocal_stmt ::= "nonlocal" identifier ("," identifier)*

When the definition of a function or class is nested (enclosed) within
the definitions of other functions, its nonlocal scopes are the local
scopes of the enclosing functions. The "nonlocal" statement causes the
listed identifiers to refer to names previously bound in nonlocal
scopes. It allows encapsulated code to rebind such nonlocal
identifiers.  If a name is bound in more than one nonlocal scope, the
nearest binding is used. If a name is not bound in any nonlocal scope,
or if there is no nonlocal scope, a "SyntaxError" is raised.

The "nonlocal" statement applies to the entire scope of a function or
class body. A "SyntaxError" is raised if a variable is used or
assigned to prior to its nonlocal declaration in the scope.

See also:

  **PEP 3104** - Access to Names in Outer Scopes
     The specification for the "nonlocal" statement.

**Programmer’s note:** "nonlocal" is a directive to the parser and
applies only to code parsed along with it.  See the note for the
"global" statement.
''',
    'numbers': r'''Numeric literals
****************

There are three types of numeric literals: integers, floating-point
numbers, and imaginary numbers.  There are no complex literals
(complex numbers can be formed by adding a real number and an
imaginary number).

Note that numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like "-1"
is actually an expression composed of the unary operator ‘"-"’ and the
literal "1".
''',
    'numeric-types': r'''Emulating numeric types
***********************

The following methods can be defined to emulate numeric objects.
Methods corresponding to operations that are not supported by the
particular kind of number implemented (e.g., bitwise operations for
non-integral numbers) should be left undefined.

object.__add__(self, other)
object.__sub__(self, other)
object.__mul__(self, other)
object.__matmul__(self, other)
object.__truediv__(self, other)
object.__floordiv__(self, other)
object.__mod__(self, other)
object.__divmod__(self, other)
object.__pow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__lshift__(self, other)
object.__rshift__(self, other)
object.__and__(self, other)
object.__xor__(self, other)
object.__or__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic
   operations ("+", "-", "*", "@", "/", "//", "%", "divmod()",
   "pow()", "**", "<<", ">>", "&", "^", "|").  For instance, to
   evaluate the expression "x + y", where *x* is an instance of a
   class that has an "__add__()" method, "type(x).__add__(x, y)" is
   called.  The "__divmod__()" method should be the equivalent to
   using "__floordiv__()" and "__mod__()"; it should not be related to
   "__truediv__()".  Note that "__pow__()" should be defined to accept
   an optional third argument if the ternary version of the built-in
   "pow()" function is to be supported.

   If one of those methods does not support the operation with the
   supplied arguments, it should return "NotImplemented".

object.__radd__(self, other)
object.__rsub__(self, other)
object.__rmul__(self, other)
object.__rmatmul__(self, other)
object.__rtruediv__(self, other)
object.__rfloordiv__(self, other)
object.__rmod__(self, other)
object.__rdivmod__(self, other)
object.__rpow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__rlshift__(self, other)
object.__rrshift__(self, other)
object.__rand__(self, other)
object.__rxor__(self, other)
object.__ror__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic
   operations ("+", "-", "*", "@", "/", "//", "%", "divmod()",
   "pow()", "**", "<<", ">>", "&", "^", "|") with reflected (swapped)
   operands.  These functions are only called if the left operand does
   not support the corresponding operation [3] and the operands are of
   different types. [4] For instance, to evaluate the expression "x -
   y", where *y* is an instance of a class that has an "__rsub__()"
   method, "type(y).__rsub__(y, x)" is called if "type(x).__sub__(x,
   y)" returns "NotImplemented".

   Note that ternary "pow()" will not try calling "__rpow__()" (the
   coercion rules would become too complicated).

   Note:

     If the right operand’s type is a subclass of the left operand’s
     type and that subclass provides a different implementation of the
     reflected method for the operation, this method will be called
     before the left operand’s non-reflected method. This behavior
     allows subclasses to override their ancestors’ operations.

object.__iadd__(self, other)
object.__isub__(self, other)
object.__imul__(self, other)
object.__imatmul__(self, other)
object.__itruediv__(self, other)
object.__ifloordiv__(self, other)
object.__imod__(self, other)
object.__ipow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__ilshift__(self, other)
object.__irshift__(self, other)
object.__iand__(self, other)
object.__ixor__(self, other)
object.__ior__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic
   assignments ("+=", "-=", "*=", "@=", "/=", "//=", "%=", "**=",
   "<<=", ">>=", "&=", "^=", "|=").  These methods should attempt to
   do the operation in-place (modifying *self*) and return the result
   (which could be, but does not have to be, *self*).  If a specific
   method is not defined, or if that method returns "NotImplemented",
   the augmented assignment falls back to the normal methods.  For
   instance, if *x* is an instance of a class with an "__iadd__()"
   method, "x += y" is equivalent to "x = x.__iadd__(y)" . If
   "__iadd__()" does not exist, or if "x.__iadd__(y)" returns
   "NotImplemented", "x.__add__(y)" and "y.__radd__(x)" are
   considered, as with the evaluation of "x + y". In certain
   situations, augmented assignment can result in unexpected errors
   (see Why does a_tuple[i] += [‘item’] raise an exception when the
   addition works?), but this behavior is in fact part of the data
   model.

object.__neg__(self)
object.__pos__(self)
object.__abs__(self)
object.__invert__(self)

   Called to implement the unary arithmetic operations ("-", "+",
   "abs()" and "~").

object.__complex__(self)
object.__int__(self)
object.__float__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in functions "complex()", "int()" and
   "float()".  Should return a value of the appropriate type.

object.__index__(self)

   Called to implement "operator.index()", and whenever Python needs
   to losslessly convert the numeric object to an integer object (such
   as in slicing, or in the built-in "bin()", "hex()" and "oct()"
   functions). Presence of this method indicates that the numeric
   object is an integer type.  Must return an integer.

   If "__int__()", "__float__()" and "__complex__()" are not defined
   then corresponding built-in functions "int()", "float()" and
   "complex()" fall back to "__index__()".

object.__round__(self[, ndigits])
object.__trunc__(self)
object.__floor__(self)
object.__ceil__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in function "round()" and "math"
   functions "trunc()", "floor()" and "ceil()". Unless *ndigits* is
   passed to "__round__()" all these methods should return the value
   of the object truncated to an "Integral" (typically an "int").

   The built-in function "int()" falls back to "__trunc__()" if
   neither "__int__()" nor "__index__()" is defined.

   Changed in version 3.11: The delegation of "int()" to "__trunc__()"
   is deprecated.
''',
    'objects': r'''Objects, values and types
*************************

*Objects* are Python’s abstraction for data.  All data in a Python
program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In
a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored
program computer”, code is also represented by objects.)

Every object has an identity, a type and a value.  An object’s
*identity* never changes once it has been created; you may think of it
as the object’s address in memory.  The "is" operator compares the
identity of two objects; the "id()" function returns an integer
representing its identity.

**CPython implementation detail:** For CPython, "id(x)" is the memory
address where "x" is stored.

An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports
(e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values
for objects of that type.  The "type()" function returns an object’s
type (which is an object itself).  Like its identity, an object’s
*type* is also unchangeable. [1]

The *value* of some objects can change.  Objects whose value can
change are said to be *mutable*; objects whose value is unchangeable
once they are created are called *immutable*. (The value of an
immutable container object that contains a reference to a mutable
object can change when the latter’s value is changed; however the
container is still considered immutable, because the collection of
objects it contains cannot be changed.  So, immutability is not
strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more subtle.)
An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance,
numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and
lists are mutable.

Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become
unreachable they may be garbage-collected.  An implementation is
allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether — it is a
matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is
implemented, as long as no objects are collected that are still
reachable.

**CPython implementation detail:** CPython currently uses a reference-
counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked
garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become
unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing
circular references.  See the documentation of the "gc" module for
information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage. Other
implementations act differently and CPython may change. Do not depend
on immediate finalization of objects when they become unreachable (so
you should always close files explicitly).

Note that the use of the implementation’s tracing or debugging
facilities may keep objects alive that would normally be collectable.
Also note that catching an exception with a "try"…"except" statement
may keep objects alive.

Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open
files or windows.  It is understood that these resources are freed
when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is
not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to
release the external resource, usually a "close()" method. Programs
are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects.  The
"try"…"finally" statement and the "with" statement provide convenient
ways to do this.

Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called
*containers*. Examples of containers are tuples, lists and
dictionaries.  The references are part of a container’s value.  In
most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the
values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we
talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the
immediately contained objects are implied.  So, if an immutable
container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its
value changes if that mutable object is changed.

Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior.  Even the
importance of object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable
types, operations that compute new values may actually return a
reference to any existing object with the same type and value, while
for mutable objects this is not allowed. For example, after "a = 1; b
= 1", *a* and *b* may or may not refer to the same object with the
value one, depending on the implementation. This is because "int" is
an immutable type, so the reference to "1" can be reused. This
behaviour depends on the implementation used, so should not be relied
upon, but is something to be aware of when making use of object
identity tests. However, after "c = []; d = []", *c* and *d* are
guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly created empty
lists. (Note that "e = f = []" assigns the *same* object to both *e*
and *f*.)
''',
    'operator-summary': r'''Operator precedence
*******************

The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python, from
highest precedence (most binding) to lowest precedence (least
binding).  Operators in the same box have the same precedence.  Unless
the syntax is explicitly given, operators are binary.  Operators in
the same box group left to right (except for exponentiation and
conditional expressions, which group from right to left).

Note that comparisons, membership tests, and identity tests, all have
the same precedence and have a left-to-right chaining feature as
described in the Comparisons section.

-[ Footnotes ]-

[1] While "abs(x%y) < abs(y)" is true mathematically, for floats it
    may not be true numerically due to roundoff.  For example, and
    assuming a platform on which a Python float is an IEEE 754 double-
    precision number, in order that "-1e-100 % 1e100" have the same
    sign as "1e100", the computed result is "-1e-100 + 1e100", which
    is numerically exactly equal to "1e100".  The function
    "math.fmod()" returns a result whose sign matches the sign of the
    first argument instead, and so returns "-1e-100" in this case.
    Which approach is more appropriate depends on the application.

[2] If x is very close to an exact integer multiple of y, it’s
    possible for "x//y" to be one larger than "(x-x%y)//y" due to
    rounding.  In such cases, Python returns the latter result, in
    order to preserve that "divmod(x,y)[0] * y + x % y" be very close
    to "x".

[3] The Unicode standard distinguishes between *code points* (e.g.
    U+0041) and *abstract characters* (e.g. “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A”).
    While most abstract characters in Unicode are only represented
    using one code point, there is a number of abstract characters
    that can in addition be represented using a sequence of more than
    one code point.  For example, the abstract character “LATIN
    CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA” can be represented as a single
    *precomposed character* at code position U+00C7, or as a sequence
    of a *base character* at code position U+0043 (LATIN CAPITAL
    LETTER C), followed by a *combining character* at code position
    U+0327 (COMBINING CEDILLA).

    The comparison operators on strings compare at the level of
    Unicode code points. This may be counter-intuitive to humans.  For
    example, ""\u00C7" == "\u0043\u0327"" is "False", even though both
    strings represent the same abstract character “LATIN CAPITAL
    LETTER C WITH CEDILLA”.

    To compare strings at the level of abstract characters (that is,
    in a way intuitive to humans), use "unicodedata.normalize()".

[4] Due to automatic garbage-collection, free lists, and the dynamic
    nature of descriptors, you may notice seemingly unusual behaviour
    in certain uses of the "is" operator, like those involving
    comparisons between instance methods, or constants.  Check their
    documentation for more info.

[5] The power operator "**" binds less tightly than an arithmetic or
    bitwise unary operator on its right, that is, "2**-1" is "0.5".

[6] The "%" operator is also used for string formatting; the same
    precedence applies.
''',
    'pass': r'''The "pass" statement
********************

   pass_stmt ::= "pass"

"pass" is a null operation — when it is executed, nothing happens. It
is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically,
but no code needs to be executed, for example:

   def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

   class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)
''',
    'power': r'''The power operator
******************

The power operator binds more tightly than unary operators on its
left; it binds less tightly than unary operators on its right.  The
syntax is:

   power ::= (await_expr | primary) ["**" u_expr]

Thus, in an unparenthesized sequence of power and unary operators, the
operators are evaluated from right to left (this does not constrain
the evaluation order for the operands): "-1**2" results in "-1".

The power operator has the same semantics as the built-in "pow()"
function, when called with two arguments: it yields its left argument
raised to the power of its right argument.  The numeric arguments are
first converted to a common type, and the result is of that type.

For int operands, the result has the same type as the operands unless
the second argument is negative; in that case, all arguments are
converted to float and a float result is delivered. For example,
"10**2" returns "100", but "10**-2" returns "0.01".

Raising "0.0" to a negative power results in a "ZeroDivisionError".
Raising a negative number to a fractional power results in a "complex"
number. (In earlier versions it raised a "ValueError".)

This operation can be customized using the special "__pow__()" and
"__rpow__()" methods.
''',
    'raise': r'''The "raise" statement
*********************

   raise_stmt ::= "raise" [expression ["from" expression]]

If no expressions are present, "raise" re-raises the exception that is
currently being handled, which is also known as the *active
exception*. If there isn’t currently an active exception, a
"RuntimeError" exception is raised indicating that this is an error.

Otherwise, "raise" evaluates the first expression as the exception
object.  It must be either a subclass or an instance of
"BaseException". If it is a class, the exception instance will be
obtained when needed by instantiating the class with no arguments.

The *type* of the exception is the exception instance’s class, the
*value* is the instance itself.

A traceback object is normally created automatically when an exception
is raised and attached to it as the "__traceback__" attribute. You can
create an exception and set your own traceback in one step using the
"with_traceback()" exception method (which returns the same exception
instance, with its traceback set to its argument), like so:

   raise Exception("foo occurred").with_traceback(tracebackobj)

The "from" clause is used for exception chaining: if given, the second
*expression* must be another exception class or instance. If the
second expression is an exception instance, it will be attached to the
raised exception as the "__cause__" attribute (which is writable). If
the expression is an exception class, the class will be instantiated
and the resulting exception instance will be attached to the raised
exception as the "__cause__" attribute. If the raised exception is not
handled, both exceptions will be printed:

   >>> try:
   ...     print(1 / 0)
   ... except Exception as exc:
   ...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") from exc
   ...
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
       print(1 / 0)
             ~~^~~
   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

   The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
       raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") from exc
   RuntimeError: Something bad happened

A similar mechanism works implicitly if a new exception is raised when
an exception is already being handled.  An exception may be handled
when an "except" or "finally" clause, or a "with" statement, is used.
The previous exception is then attached as the new exception’s
"__context__" attribute:

   >>> try:
   ...     print(1 / 0)
   ... except:
   ...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened")
   ...
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
       print(1 / 0)
             ~~^~~
   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

   During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
       raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened")
   RuntimeError: Something bad happened

Exception chaining can be explicitly suppressed by specifying "None"
in the "from" clause:

   >>> try:
   ...     print(1 / 0)
   ... except:
   ...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") from None
   ...
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
   RuntimeError: Something bad happened

Additional information on exceptions can be found in section
Exceptions, and information about handling exceptions is in section
The try statement.

Changed in version 3.3: "None" is now permitted as "Y" in "raise X
from Y".Added the "__suppress_context__" attribute to suppress
automatic display of the exception context.

Changed in version 3.11: If the traceback of the active exception is
modified in an "except" clause, a subsequent "raise" statement re-
raises the exception with the modified traceback. Previously, the
exception was re-raised with the traceback it had when it was caught.
''',
    'return': r'''The "return" statement
**********************

   return_stmt ::= "return" [expression_list]

"return" may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition,
not within a nested class definition.

If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else "None" is
substituted.

"return" leaves the current function call with the expression list (or
"None") as return value.

When "return" passes control out of a "try" statement with a "finally"
clause, that "finally" clause is executed before really leaving the
function.

In a generator function, the "return" statement indicates that the
generator is done and will cause "StopIteration" to be raised. The
returned value (if any) is used as an argument to construct
"StopIteration" and becomes the "StopIteration.value" attribute.

In an asynchronous generator function, an empty "return" statement
indicates that the asynchronous generator is done and will cause
"StopAsyncIteration" to be raised.  A non-empty "return" statement is
a syntax error in an asynchronous generator function.
''',
    'sequence-types': r'''Emulating container types
*************************

The following methods can be defined to implement container objects.
None of them are provided by the "object" class itself. Containers
usually are *sequences* (such as "lists" or "tuples") or *mappings*
(like *dictionaries*), but can represent other containers as well.
The first set of methods is used either to emulate a sequence or to
emulate a mapping; the difference is that for a sequence, the
allowable keys should be the integers *k* for which "0 <= k < N" where
*N* is the length of the sequence, or "slice" objects, which define a
range of items.  It is also recommended that mappings provide the
methods "keys()", "values()", "items()", "get()", "clear()",
"setdefault()", "pop()", "popitem()", "copy()", and "update()"
behaving similar to those for Python’s standard "dictionary" objects.
The "collections.abc" module provides a "MutableMapping" *abstract
base class* to help create those methods from a base set of
"__getitem__()", "__setitem__()", "__delitem__()", and "keys()".
Mutable sequences should provide methods "append()", "count()",
"index()", "extend()", "insert()", "pop()", "remove()", "reverse()"
and "sort()", like Python standard "list" objects. Finally, sequence
types should implement addition (meaning concatenation) and
multiplication (meaning repetition) by defining the methods
"__add__()", "__radd__()", "__iadd__()", "__mul__()", "__rmul__()" and
"__imul__()" described below; they should not define other numerical
operators.  It is recommended that both mappings and sequences
implement the "__contains__()" method to allow efficient use of the
"in" operator; for mappings, "in" should search the mapping’s keys;
for sequences, it should search through the values.  It is further
recommended that both mappings and sequences implement the
"__iter__()" method to allow efficient iteration through the
container; for mappings, "__iter__()" should iterate through the
object’s keys; for sequences, it should iterate through the values.

object.__len__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in function "len()".  Should return
   the length of the object, an integer ">=" 0.  Also, an object that
   doesn’t define a "__bool__()" method and whose "__len__()" method
   returns zero is considered to be false in a Boolean context.

   **CPython implementation detail:** In CPython, the length is
   required to be at most "sys.maxsize". If the length is larger than
   "sys.maxsize" some features (such as "len()") may raise
   "OverflowError".  To prevent raising "OverflowError" by truth value
   testing, an object must define a "__bool__()" method.

object.__length_hint__(self)

   Called to implement "operator.length_hint()". Should return an
   estimated length for the object (which may be greater or less than
   the actual length). The length must be an integer ">=" 0. The
   return value may also be "NotImplemented", which is treated the
   same as if the "__length_hint__" method didn’t exist at all. This
   method is purely an optimization and is never required for
   correctness.

   Added in version 3.4.

Note:

  Slicing is done exclusively with the following three methods.  A
  call like

     a[1:2] = b

  is translated to

     a[slice(1, 2, None)] = b

  and so forth.  Missing slice items are always filled in with "None".

object.__getitem__(self, key)

   Called to implement evaluation of "self[key]". For *sequence*
   types, the accepted keys should be integers. Optionally, they may
   support "slice" objects as well.  Negative index support is also
   optional. If *key* is of an inappropriate type, "TypeError" may be
   raised; if *key* is a value outside the set of indexes for the
   sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values),
   "IndexError" should be raised. For *mapping* types, if *key* is
   missing (not in the container), "KeyError" should be raised.

   Note:

     "for" loops expect that an "IndexError" will be raised for
     illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the
     sequence.

   Note:

     When subscripting a *class*, the special class method
     "__class_getitem__()" may be called instead of "__getitem__()".
     See __class_getitem__ versus __getitem__ for more details.

object.__setitem__(self, key, value)

   Called to implement assignment to "self[key]".  Same note as for
   "__getitem__()".  This should only be implemented for mappings if
   the objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys
   can be added, or for sequences if elements can be replaced.  The
   same exceptions should be raised for improper *key* values as for
   the "__getitem__()" method.

object.__delitem__(self, key)

   Called to implement deletion of "self[key]".  Same note as for
   "__getitem__()".  This should only be implemented for mappings if
   the objects support removal of keys, or for sequences if elements
   can be removed from the sequence.  The same exceptions should be
   raised for improper *key* values as for the "__getitem__()" method.

object.__missing__(self, key)

   Called by "dict"."__getitem__()" to implement "self[key]" for dict
   subclasses when key is not in the dictionary.

object.__iter__(self)

   This method is called when an *iterator* is required for a
   container. This method should return a new iterator object that can
   iterate over all the objects in the container.  For mappings, it
   should iterate over the keys of the container.

object.__reversed__(self)

   Called (if present) by the "reversed()" built-in to implement
   reverse iteration.  It should return a new iterator object that
   iterates over all the objects in the container in reverse order.

   If the "__reversed__()" method is not provided, the "reversed()"
   built-in will fall back to using the sequence protocol ("__len__()"
   and "__getitem__()").  Objects that support the sequence protocol
   should only provide "__reversed__()" if they can provide an
   implementation that is more efficient than the one provided by
   "reversed()".

The membership test operators ("in" and "not in") are normally
implemented as an iteration through a container. However, container
objects can supply the following special method with a more efficient
implementation, which also does not require the object be iterable.

object.__contains__(self, item)

   Called to implement membership test operators.  Should return true
   if *item* is in *self*, false otherwise.  For mapping objects, this
   should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or
   the key-item pairs.

   For objects that don’t define "__contains__()", the membership test
   first tries iteration via "__iter__()", then the old sequence
   iteration protocol via "__getitem__()", see this section in the
   language reference.
''',
    'shifting': r'''Shifting operations
*******************

The shifting operations have lower priority than the arithmetic
operations:

   shift_expr ::= a_expr | shift_expr ("<<" | ">>") a_expr

These operators accept integers as arguments.  They shift the first
argument to the left or right by the number of bits given by the
second argument.

The left shift operation can be customized using the special
"__lshift__()" and "__rlshift__()" methods. The right shift operation
can be customized using the special "__rshift__()" and "__rrshift__()"
methods.

A right shift by *n* bits is defined as floor division by "pow(2,n)".
A left shift by *n* bits is defined as multiplication with "pow(2,n)".
''',
    'slicings': r'''Slicings
********

A slicing selects a range of items in a sequence object (e.g., a
string, tuple or list).  Slicings may be used as expressions or as
targets in assignment or "del" statements.  The syntax for a slicing:

   slicing      ::= primary "[" slice_list "]"
   slice_list   ::= slice_item ("," slice_item)* [","]
   slice_item   ::= expression | proper_slice
   proper_slice ::= [lower_bound] ":" [upper_bound] [ ":" [stride] ]
   lower_bound  ::= expression
   upper_bound  ::= expression
   stride       ::= expression

There is ambiguity in the formal syntax here: anything that looks like
an expression list also looks like a slice list, so any subscription
can be interpreted as a slicing.  Rather than further complicating the
syntax, this is disambiguated by defining that in this case the
interpretation as a subscription takes priority over the
interpretation as a slicing (this is the case if the slice list
contains no proper slice).

The semantics for a slicing are as follows.  The primary is indexed
(using the same "__getitem__()" method as normal subscription) with a
key that is constructed from the slice list, as follows.  If the slice
list contains at least one comma, the key is a tuple containing the
conversion of the slice items; otherwise, the conversion of the lone
slice item is the key.  The conversion of a slice item that is an
expression is that expression.  The conversion of a proper slice is a
slice object (see section The standard type hierarchy) whose "start",
"stop" and "step" attributes are the values of the expressions given
as lower bound, upper bound and stride, respectively, substituting
"None" for missing expressions.
''',
    'specialattrs': r'''Special Attributes
******************

The implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several
object types, where they are relevant.  Some of these are not reported
by the "dir()" built-in function.

definition.__name__

   The name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator
   instance.

definition.__qualname__

   The *qualified name* of the class, function, method, descriptor, or
   generator instance.

   Added in version 3.3.

definition.__module__

   The name of the module in which a class or function was defined.

definition.__doc__

   The documentation string of a class or function, or "None" if
   undefined.

definition.__type_params__

   The type parameters of generic classes, functions, and type
   aliases. For classes and functions that are not generic, this will
   be an empty tuple.

   Added in version 3.12.
''',
    'specialnames': r'''Special method names
********************

A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special
syntax (such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by
defining methods with special names. This is Python’s approach to
*operator overloading*, allowing classes to define their own behavior
with respect to language operators.  For instance, if a class defines
a method named "__getitem__()", and "x" is an instance of this class,
then "x[i]" is roughly equivalent to "type(x).__getitem__(x, i)".
Except where mentioned, attempts to execute an operation raise an
exception when no appropriate method is defined (typically
"AttributeError" or "TypeError").

Setting a special method to "None" indicates that the corresponding
operation is not available.  For example, if a class sets "__iter__()"
to "None", the class is not iterable, so calling "iter()" on its
instances will raise a "TypeError" (without falling back to
"__getitem__()"). [2]

When implementing a class that emulates any built-in type, it is
important that the emulation only be implemented to the degree that it
makes sense for the object being modelled.  For example, some
sequences may work well with retrieval of individual elements, but
extracting a slice may not make sense.  (One example of this is the
"NodeList" interface in the W3C’s Document Object Model.)


Basic customization
===================

object.__new__(cls[, ...])

   Called to create a new instance of class *cls*.  "__new__()" is a
   static method (special-cased so you need not declare it as such)
   that takes the class of which an instance was requested as its
   first argument.  The remaining arguments are those passed to the
   object constructor expression (the call to the class).  The return
   value of "__new__()" should be the new object instance (usually an
   instance of *cls*).

   Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by
   invoking the superclass’s "__new__()" method using
   "super().__new__(cls[, ...])" with appropriate arguments and then
   modifying the newly created instance as necessary before returning
   it.

   If "__new__()" is invoked during object construction and it returns
   an instance of *cls*, then the new instance’s "__init__()" method
   will be invoked like "__init__(self[, ...])", where *self* is the
   new instance and the remaining arguments are the same as were
   passed to the object constructor.

   If "__new__()" does not return an instance of *cls*, then the new
   instance’s "__init__()" method will not be invoked.

   "__new__()" is intended mainly to allow subclasses of immutable
   types (like int, str, or tuple) to customize instance creation.  It
   is also commonly overridden in custom metaclasses in order to
   customize class creation.

object.__init__(self[, ...])

   Called after the instance has been created (by "__new__()"), but
   before it is returned to the caller.  The arguments are those
   passed to the class constructor expression.  If a base class has an
   "__init__()" method, the derived class’s "__init__()" method, if
   any, must explicitly call it to ensure proper initialization of the
   base class part of the instance; for example:
   "super().__init__([args...])".

   Because "__new__()" and "__init__()" work together in constructing
   objects ("__new__()" to create it, and "__init__()" to customize
   it), no non-"None" value may be returned by "__init__()"; doing so
   will cause a "TypeError" to be raised at runtime.

object.__del__(self)

   Called when the instance is about to be destroyed.  This is also
   called a finalizer or (improperly) a destructor.  If a base class
   has a "__del__()" method, the derived class’s "__del__()" method,
   if any, must explicitly call it to ensure proper deletion of the
   base class part of the instance.

   It is possible (though not recommended!) for the "__del__()" method
   to postpone destruction of the instance by creating a new reference
   to it.  This is called object *resurrection*.  It is
   implementation-dependent whether "__del__()" is called a second
   time when a resurrected object is about to be destroyed; the
   current *CPython* implementation only calls it once.

   It is not guaranteed that "__del__()" methods are called for
   objects that still exist when the interpreter exits.
   "weakref.finalize" provides a straightforward way to register a
   cleanup function to be called when an object is garbage collected.

   Note:

     "del x" doesn’t directly call "x.__del__()" — the former
     decrements the reference count for "x" by one, and the latter is
     only called when "x"’s reference count reaches zero.

   **CPython implementation detail:** It is possible for a reference
   cycle to prevent the reference count of an object from going to
   zero.  In this case, the cycle will be later detected and deleted
   by the *cyclic garbage collector*.  A common cause of reference
   cycles is when an exception has been caught in a local variable.
   The frame’s locals then reference the exception, which references
   its own traceback, which references the locals of all frames caught
   in the traceback.

   See also: Documentation for the "gc" module.

   Warning:

     Due to the precarious circumstances under which "__del__()"
     methods are invoked, exceptions that occur during their execution
     are ignored, and a warning is printed to "sys.stderr" instead.
     In particular:

     * "__del__()" can be invoked when arbitrary code is being
       executed, including from any arbitrary thread.  If "__del__()"
       needs to take a lock or invoke any other blocking resource, it
       may deadlock as the resource may already be taken by the code
       that gets interrupted to execute "__del__()".

     * "__del__()" can be executed during interpreter shutdown.  As a
       consequence, the global variables it needs to access (including
       other modules) may already have been deleted or set to "None".
       Python guarantees that globals whose name begins with a single
       underscore are deleted from their module before other globals
       are deleted; if no other references to such globals exist, this
       may help in assuring that imported modules are still available
       at the time when the "__del__()" method is called.

object.__repr__(self)

   Called by the "repr()" built-in function to compute the “official”
   string representation of an object.  If at all possible, this
   should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to
   recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate
   environment).  If this is not possible, a string of the form
   "<...some useful description...>" should be returned. The return
   value must be a string object. If a class defines "__repr__()" but
   not "__str__()", then "__repr__()" is also used when an “informal”
   string representation of instances of that class is required.

   This is typically used for debugging, so it is important that the
   representation is information-rich and unambiguous. A default
   implementation is provided by the "object" class itself.

object.__str__(self)

   Called by "str(object)", the default "__format__()" implementation,
   and the built-in function "print()", to compute the “informal” or
   nicely printable string representation of an object.  The return
   value must be a str object.

   This method differs from "object.__repr__()" in that there is no
   expectation that "__str__()" return a valid Python expression: a
   more convenient or concise representation can be used.

   The default implementation defined by the built-in type "object"
   calls "object.__repr__()".

object.__bytes__(self)

   Called by bytes to compute a byte-string representation of an
   object. This should return a "bytes" object. The "object" class
   itself does not provide this method.

object.__format__(self, format_spec)

   Called by the "format()" built-in function, and by extension,
   evaluation of formatted string literals and the "str.format()"
   method, to produce a “formatted” string representation of an
   object. The *format_spec* argument is a string that contains a
   description of the formatting options desired. The interpretation
   of the *format_spec* argument is up to the type implementing
   "__format__()", however most classes will either delegate
   formatting to one of the built-in types, or use a similar
   formatting option syntax.

   See Format Specification Mini-Language for a description of the
   standard formatting syntax.

   The return value must be a string object.

   The default implementation by the "object" class should be given an
   empty *format_spec* string. It delegates to "__str__()".

   Changed in version 3.4: The __format__ method of "object" itself
   raises a "TypeError" if passed any non-empty string.

   Changed in version 3.7: "object.__format__(x, '')" is now
   equivalent to "str(x)" rather than "format(str(x), '')".

object.__lt__(self, other)
object.__le__(self, other)
object.__eq__(self, other)
object.__ne__(self, other)
object.__gt__(self, other)
object.__ge__(self, other)

   These are the so-called “rich comparison” methods. The
   correspondence between operator symbols and method names is as
   follows: "x<y" calls "x.__lt__(y)", "x<=y" calls "x.__le__(y)",
   "x==y" calls "x.__eq__(y)", "x!=y" calls "x.__ne__(y)", "x>y" calls
   "x.__gt__(y)", and "x>=y" calls "x.__ge__(y)".

   A rich comparison method may return the singleton "NotImplemented"
   if it does not implement the operation for a given pair of
   arguments. By convention, "False" and "True" are returned for a
   successful comparison. However, these methods can return any value,
   so if the comparison operator is used in a Boolean context (e.g.,
   in the condition of an "if" statement), Python will call "bool()"
   on the value to determine if the result is true or false.

   By default, "object" implements "__eq__()" by using "is", returning
   "NotImplemented" in the case of a false comparison: "True if x is y
   else NotImplemented". For "__ne__()", by default it delegates to
   "__eq__()" and inverts the result unless it is "NotImplemented".
   There are no other implied relationships among the comparison
   operators or default implementations; for example, the truth of
   "(x<y or x==y)" does not imply "x<=y". To automatically generate
   ordering operations from a single root operation, see
   "functools.total_ordering()".

   By default, the "object" class provides implementations consistent
   with Value comparisons: equality compares according to object
   identity, and order comparisons raise "TypeError". Each default
   method may generate these results directly, but may also return
   "NotImplemented".

   See the paragraph on "__hash__()" for some important notes on
   creating *hashable* objects which support custom comparison
   operations and are usable as dictionary keys.

   There are no swapped-argument versions of these methods (to be used
   when the left argument does not support the operation but the right
   argument does); rather, "__lt__()" and "__gt__()" are each other’s
   reflection, "__le__()" and "__ge__()" are each other’s reflection,
   and "__eq__()" and "__ne__()" are their own reflection. If the
   operands are of different types, and the right operand’s type is a
   direct or indirect subclass of the left operand’s type, the
   reflected method of the right operand has priority, otherwise the
   left operand’s method has priority.  Virtual subclassing is not
   considered.

   When no appropriate method returns any value other than
   "NotImplemented", the "==" and "!=" operators will fall back to
   "is" and "is not", respectively.

object.__hash__(self)

   Called by built-in function "hash()" and for operations on members
   of hashed collections including "set", "frozenset", and "dict".
   The "__hash__()" method should return an integer. The only required
   property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash
   value; it is advised to mix together the hash values of the
   components of the object that also play a part in comparison of
   objects by packing them into a tuple and hashing the tuple.
   Example:

      def __hash__(self):
          return hash((self.name, self.nick, self.color))

   Note:

     "hash()" truncates the value returned from an object’s custom
     "__hash__()" method to the size of a "Py_ssize_t".  This is
     typically 8 bytes on 64-bit builds and 4 bytes on 32-bit builds.
     If an object’s   "__hash__()" must interoperate on builds of
     different bit sizes, be sure to check the width on all supported
     builds.  An easy way to do this is with "python -c "import sys;
     print(sys.hash_info.width)"".

   If a class does not define an "__eq__()" method it should not
   define a "__hash__()" operation either; if it defines "__eq__()"
   but not "__hash__()", its instances will not be usable as items in
   hashable collections.  If a class defines mutable objects and
   implements an "__eq__()" method, it should not implement
   "__hash__()", since the implementation of *hashable* collections
   requires that a key’s hash value is immutable (if the object’s hash
   value changes, it will be in the wrong hash bucket).

   User-defined classes have "__eq__()" and "__hash__()" methods by
   default (inherited from the "object" class); with them, all objects
   compare unequal (except with themselves) and "x.__hash__()" returns
   an appropriate value such that "x == y" implies both that "x is y"
   and "hash(x) == hash(y)".

   A class that overrides "__eq__()" and does not define "__hash__()"
   will have its "__hash__()" implicitly set to "None".  When the
   "__hash__()" method of a class is "None", instances of the class
   will raise an appropriate "TypeError" when a program attempts to
   retrieve their hash value, and will also be correctly identified as
   unhashable when checking "isinstance(obj,
   collections.abc.Hashable)".

   If a class that overrides "__eq__()" needs to retain the
   implementation of "__hash__()" from a parent class, the interpreter
   must be told this explicitly by setting "__hash__ =
   <ParentClass>.__hash__".

   If a class that does not override "__eq__()" wishes to suppress
   hash support, it should include "__hash__ = None" in the class
   definition. A class which defines its own "__hash__()" that
   explicitly raises a "TypeError" would be incorrectly identified as
   hashable by an "isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Hashable)" call.

   Note:

     By default, the "__hash__()" values of str and bytes objects are
     “salted” with an unpredictable random value.  Although they
     remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not
     predictable between repeated invocations of Python.This is
     intended to provide protection against a denial-of-service caused
     by carefully chosen inputs that exploit the worst case
     performance of a dict insertion, *O*(*n*^2) complexity.  See
     http://ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html for
     details.Changing hash values affects the iteration order of sets.
     Python has never made guarantees about this ordering (and it
     typically varies between 32-bit and 64-bit builds).See also
     "PYTHONHASHSEED".

   Changed in version 3.3: Hash randomization is enabled by default.

object.__bool__(self)

   Called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation
   "bool()"; should return "False" or "True".  When this method is not
   defined, "__len__()" is called, if it is defined, and the object is
   considered true if its result is nonzero.  If a class defines
   neither "__len__()" nor "__bool__()" (which is true of the "object"
   class itself), all its instances are considered true.


Customizing attribute access
============================

The following methods can be defined to customize the meaning of
attribute access (use of, assignment to, or deletion of "x.name") for
class instances.

object.__getattr__(self, name)

   Called when the default attribute access fails with an
   "AttributeError" (either "__getattribute__()" raises an
   "AttributeError" because *name* is not an instance attribute or an
   attribute in the class tree for "self"; or "__get__()" of a *name*
   property raises "AttributeError").  This method should either
   return the (computed) attribute value or raise an "AttributeError"
   exception. The "object" class itself does not provide this method.

   Note that if the attribute is found through the normal mechanism,
   "__getattr__()" is not called.  (This is an intentional asymmetry
   between "__getattr__()" and "__setattr__()".) This is done both for
   efficiency reasons and because otherwise "__getattr__()" would have
   no way to access other attributes of the instance.  Note that at
   least for instance variables, you can take total control by not
   inserting any values in the instance attribute dictionary (but
   instead inserting them in another object).  See the
   "__getattribute__()" method below for a way to actually get total
   control over attribute access.

object.__getattribute__(self, name)

   Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for
   instances of the class. If the class also defines "__getattr__()",
   the latter will not be called unless "__getattribute__()" either
   calls it explicitly or raises an "AttributeError". This method
   should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an
   "AttributeError" exception. In order to avoid infinite recursion in
   this method, its implementation should always call the base class
   method with the same name to access any attributes it needs, for
   example, "object.__getattribute__(self, name)".

   Note:

     This method may still be bypassed when looking up special methods
     as the result of implicit invocation via language syntax or
     built-in functions. See Special method lookup.

   For certain sensitive attribute accesses, raises an auditing event
   "object.__getattr__" with arguments "obj" and "name".

object.__setattr__(self, name, value)

   Called when an attribute assignment is attempted.  This is called
   instead of the normal mechanism (i.e. store the value in the
   instance dictionary). *name* is the attribute name, *value* is the
   value to be assigned to it.

   If "__setattr__()" wants to assign to an instance attribute, it
   should call the base class method with the same name, for example,
   "object.__setattr__(self, name, value)".

   For certain sensitive attribute assignments, raises an auditing
   event "object.__setattr__" with arguments "obj", "name", "value".

object.__delattr__(self, name)

   Like "__setattr__()" but for attribute deletion instead of
   assignment.  This should only be implemented if "del obj.name" is
   meaningful for the object.

   For certain sensitive attribute deletions, raises an auditing event
   "object.__delattr__" with arguments "obj" and "name".

object.__dir__(self)

   Called when "dir()" is called on the object. An iterable must be
   returned. "dir()" converts the returned iterable to a list and
   sorts it.


Customizing module attribute access
-----------------------------------

Special names "__getattr__" and "__dir__" can be also used to
customize access to module attributes. The "__getattr__" function at
the module level should accept one argument which is the name of an
attribute and return the computed value or raise an "AttributeError".
If an attribute is not found on a module object through the normal
lookup, i.e. "object.__getattribute__()", then "__getattr__" is
searched in the module "__dict__" before raising an "AttributeError".
If found, it is called with the attribute name and the result is
returned.

The "__dir__" function should accept no arguments, and return an
iterable of strings that represents the names accessible on module. If
present, this function overrides the standard "dir()" search on a
module.

For a more fine grained customization of the module behavior (setting
attributes, properties, etc.), one can set the "__class__" attribute
of a module object to a subclass of "types.ModuleType". For example:

   import sys
   from types import ModuleType

   class VerboseModule(ModuleType):
       def __repr__(self):
           return f'Verbose {self.__name__}'

       def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
           print(f'Setting {attr}...')
           super().__setattr__(attr, value)

   sys.modules[__name__].__class__ = VerboseModule

Note:

  Defining module "__getattr__" and setting module "__class__" only
  affect lookups made using the attribute access syntax – directly
  accessing the module globals (whether by code within the module, or
  via a reference to the module’s globals dictionary) is unaffected.

Changed in version 3.5: "__class__" module attribute is now writable.

Added in version 3.7: "__getattr__" and "__dir__" module attributes.

See also:

  **PEP 562** - Module __getattr__ and __dir__
     Describes the "__getattr__" and "__dir__" functions on modules.


Implementing Descriptors
------------------------

The following methods only apply when an instance of the class
containing the method (a so-called *descriptor* class) appears in an
*owner* class (the descriptor must be in either the owner’s class
dictionary or in the class dictionary for one of its parents).  In the
examples below, “the attribute” refers to the attribute whose name is
the key of the property in the owner class’ "__dict__".  The "object"
class itself does not implement any of these protocols.

object.__get__(self, instance, owner=None)

   Called to get the attribute of the owner class (class attribute
   access) or of an instance of that class (instance attribute
   access). The optional *owner* argument is the owner class, while
   *instance* is the instance that the attribute was accessed through,
   or "None" when the attribute is accessed through the *owner*.

   This method should return the computed attribute value or raise an
   "AttributeError" exception.

   **PEP 252** specifies that "__get__()" is callable with one or two
   arguments.  Python’s own built-in descriptors support this
   specification; however, it is likely that some third-party tools
   have descriptors that require both arguments.  Python’s own
   "__getattribute__()" implementation always passes in both arguments
   whether they are required or not.

object.__set__(self, instance, value)

   Called to set the attribute on an instance *instance* of the owner
   class to a new value, *value*.

   Note, adding "__set__()" or "__delete__()" changes the kind of
   descriptor to a “data descriptor”.  See Invoking Descriptors for
   more details.

object.__delete__(self, instance)

   Called to delete the attribute on an instance *instance* of the
   owner class.

Instances of descriptors may also have the "__objclass__" attribute
present:

object.__objclass__

   The attribute "__objclass__" is interpreted by the "inspect" module
   as specifying the class where this object was defined (setting this
   appropriately can assist in runtime introspection of dynamic class
   attributes). For callables, it may indicate that an instance of the
   given type (or a subclass) is expected or required as the first
   positional argument (for example, CPython sets this attribute for
   unbound methods that are implemented in C).


Invoking Descriptors
--------------------

In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with “binding
behavior”, one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods
in the descriptor protocol:  "__get__()", "__set__()", and
"__delete__()". If any of those methods are defined for an object, it
is said to be a descriptor.

The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete
the attribute from an object’s dictionary. For instance, "a.x" has a
lookup chain starting with "a.__dict__['x']", then
"type(a).__dict__['x']", and continuing through the base classes of
"type(a)" excluding metaclasses.

However, if the looked-up value is an object defining one of the
descriptor methods, then Python may override the default behavior and
invoke the descriptor method instead.  Where this occurs in the
precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined and
how they were called.

The starting point for descriptor invocation is a binding, "a.x". How
the arguments are assembled depends on "a":

Direct Call
   The simplest and least common call is when user code directly
   invokes a descriptor method:    "x.__get__(a)".

Instance Binding
   If binding to an object instance, "a.x" is transformed into the
   call: "type(a).__dict__['x'].__get__(a, type(a))".

Class Binding
   If binding to a class, "A.x" is transformed into the call:
   "A.__dict__['x'].__get__(None, A)".

Super Binding
   A dotted lookup such as "super(A, a).x" searches
   "a.__class__.__mro__" for a base class "B" following "A" and then
   returns "B.__dict__['x'].__get__(a, A)".  If not a descriptor, "x"
   is returned unchanged.

For instance bindings, the precedence of descriptor invocation depends
on which descriptor methods are defined.  A descriptor can define any
combination of "__get__()", "__set__()" and "__delete__()".  If it
does not define "__get__()", then accessing the attribute will return
the descriptor object itself unless there is a value in the object’s
instance dictionary.  If the descriptor defines "__set__()" and/or
"__delete__()", it is a data descriptor; if it defines neither, it is
a non-data descriptor.  Normally, data descriptors define both
"__get__()" and "__set__()", while non-data descriptors have just the
"__get__()" method.  Data descriptors with "__get__()" and "__set__()"
(and/or "__delete__()") defined always override a redefinition in an
instance dictionary.  In contrast, non-data descriptors can be
overridden by instances.

Python methods (including those decorated with "@staticmethod" and
"@classmethod") are implemented as non-data descriptors.  Accordingly,
instances can redefine and override methods.  This allows individual
instances to acquire behaviors that differ from other instances of the
same class.

The "property()" function is implemented as a data descriptor.
Accordingly, instances cannot override the behavior of a property.


__slots__
---------

*__slots__* allow us to explicitly declare data members (like
properties) and deny the creation of "__dict__" and *__weakref__*
(unless explicitly declared in *__slots__* or available in a parent.)

The space saved over using "__dict__" can be significant. Attribute
lookup speed can be significantly improved as well.

object.__slots__

   This class variable can be assigned a string, iterable, or sequence
   of strings with variable names used by instances.  *__slots__*
   reserves space for the declared variables and prevents the
   automatic creation of "__dict__" and *__weakref__* for each
   instance.

Notes on using *__slots__*:

* When inheriting from a class without *__slots__*, the "__dict__" and
  *__weakref__* attribute of the instances will always be accessible.

* Without a "__dict__" variable, instances cannot be assigned new
  variables not listed in the *__slots__* definition.  Attempts to
  assign to an unlisted variable name raises "AttributeError". If
  dynamic assignment of new variables is desired, then add
  "'__dict__'" to the sequence of strings in the *__slots__*
  declaration.

* Without a *__weakref__* variable for each instance, classes defining
  *__slots__* do not support "weak references" to its instances. If
  weak reference support is needed, then add "'__weakref__'" to the
  sequence of strings in the *__slots__* declaration.

* *__slots__* are implemented at the class level by creating
  descriptors for each variable name.  As a result, class attributes
  cannot be used to set default values for instance variables defined
  by *__slots__*; otherwise, the class attribute would overwrite the
  descriptor assignment.

* The action of a *__slots__* declaration is not limited to the class
  where it is defined.  *__slots__* declared in parents are available
  in child classes. However, instances of a child subclass will get a
  "__dict__" and *__weakref__* unless the subclass also defines
  *__slots__* (which should only contain names of any *additional*
  slots).

* If a class defines a slot also defined in a base class, the instance
  variable defined by the base class slot is inaccessible (except by
  retrieving its descriptor directly from the base class). This
  renders the meaning of the program undefined.  In the future, a
  check may be added to prevent this.

* "TypeError" will be raised if nonempty *__slots__* are defined for a
  class derived from a ""variable-length" built-in type" such as
  "int", "bytes", and "tuple".

* Any non-string *iterable* may be assigned to *__slots__*.

* If a "dictionary" is used to assign *__slots__*, the dictionary keys
  will be used as the slot names. The values of the dictionary can be
  used to provide per-attribute docstrings that will be recognised by
  "inspect.getdoc()" and displayed in the output of "help()".

* "__class__" assignment works only if both classes have the same
  *__slots__*.

* Multiple inheritance with multiple slotted parent classes can be
  used, but only one parent is allowed to have attributes created by
  slots (the other bases must have empty slot layouts) - violations
  raise "TypeError".

* If an *iterator* is used for *__slots__* then a *descriptor* is
  created for each of the iterator’s values. However, the *__slots__*
  attribute will be an empty iterator.


Customizing class creation
==========================

Whenever a class inherits from another class, "__init_subclass__()" is
called on the parent class. This way, it is possible to write classes
which change the behavior of subclasses. This is closely related to
class decorators, but where class decorators only affect the specific
class they’re applied to, "__init_subclass__" solely applies to future
subclasses of the class defining the method.

classmethod object.__init_subclass__(cls)

   This method is called whenever the containing class is subclassed.
   *cls* is then the new subclass. If defined as a normal instance
   method, this method is implicitly converted to a class method.

   Keyword arguments which are given to a new class are passed to the
   parent class’s "__init_subclass__". For compatibility with other
   classes using "__init_subclass__", one should take out the needed
   keyword arguments and pass the others over to the base class, as
   in:

      class Philosopher:
          def __init_subclass__(cls, /, default_name, **kwargs):
              super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
              cls.default_name = default_name

      class AustralianPhilosopher(Philosopher, default_name="Bruce"):
          pass

   The default implementation "object.__init_subclass__" does nothing,
   but raises an error if it is called with any arguments.

   Note:

     The metaclass hint "metaclass" is consumed by the rest of the
     type machinery, and is never passed to "__init_subclass__"
     implementations. The actual metaclass (rather than the explicit
     hint) can be accessed as "type(cls)".

   Added in version 3.6.

When a class is created, "type.__new__()" scans the class variables
and makes callbacks to those with a "__set_name__()" hook.

object.__set_name__(self, owner, name)

   Automatically called at the time the owning class *owner* is
   created. The object has been assigned to *name* in that class:

      class A:
          x = C()  # Automatically calls: x.__set_name__(A, 'x')

   If the class variable is assigned after the class is created,
   "__set_name__()" will not be called automatically. If needed,
   "__set_name__()" can be called directly:

      class A:
         pass

      c = C()
      A.x = c                  # The hook is not called
      c.__set_name__(A, 'x')   # Manually invoke the hook

   See Creating the class object for more details.

   Added in version 3.6.


Metaclasses
-----------

By default, classes are constructed using "type()". The class body is
executed in a new namespace and the class name is bound locally to the
result of "type(name, bases, namespace)".

The class creation process can be customized by passing the
"metaclass" keyword argument in the class definition line, or by
inheriting from an existing class that included such an argument. In
the following example, both "MyClass" and "MySubclass" are instances
of "Meta":

   class Meta(type):
       pass

   class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
       pass

   class MySubclass(MyClass):
       pass

Any other keyword arguments that are specified in the class definition
are passed through to all metaclass operations described below.

When a class definition is executed, the following steps occur:

* MRO entries are resolved;

* the appropriate metaclass is determined;

* the class namespace is prepared;

* the class body is executed;

* the class object is created.


Resolving MRO entries
---------------------

object.__mro_entries__(self, bases)

   If a base that appears in a class definition is not an instance of
   "type", then an "__mro_entries__()" method is searched on the base.
   If an "__mro_entries__()" method is found, the base is substituted
   with the result of a call to "__mro_entries__()" when creating the
   class. The method is called with the original bases tuple passed to
   the *bases* parameter, and must return a tuple of classes that will
   be used instead of the base. The returned tuple may be empty: in
   these cases, the original base is ignored.

See also:

  "types.resolve_bases()"
     Dynamically resolve bases that are not instances of "type".

  "types.get_original_bases()"
     Retrieve a class’s “original bases” prior to modifications by
     "__mro_entries__()".

  **PEP 560**
     Core support for typing module and generic types.


Determining the appropriate metaclass
-------------------------------------

The appropriate metaclass for a class definition is determined as
follows:

* if no bases and no explicit metaclass are given, then "type()" is
  used;

* if an explicit metaclass is given and it is *not* an instance of
  "type()", then it is used directly as the metaclass;

* if an instance of "type()" is given as the explicit metaclass, or
  bases are defined, then the most derived metaclass is used.

The most derived metaclass is selected from the explicitly specified
metaclass (if any) and the metaclasses (i.e. "type(cls)") of all
specified base classes. The most derived metaclass is one which is a
subtype of *all* of these candidate metaclasses. If none of the
candidate metaclasses meets that criterion, then the class definition
will fail with "TypeError".


Preparing the class namespace
-----------------------------

Once the appropriate metaclass has been identified, then the class
namespace is prepared. If the metaclass has a "__prepare__" attribute,
it is called as "namespace = metaclass.__prepare__(name, bases,
**kwds)" (where the additional keyword arguments, if any, come from
the class definition). The "__prepare__" method should be implemented
as a "classmethod". The namespace returned by "__prepare__" is passed
in to "__new__", but when the final class object is created the
namespace is copied into a new "dict".

If the metaclass has no "__prepare__" attribute, then the class
namespace is initialised as an empty ordered mapping.

See also:

  **PEP 3115** - Metaclasses in Python 3000
     Introduced the "__prepare__" namespace hook


Executing the class body
------------------------

The class body is executed (approximately) as "exec(body, globals(),
namespace)". The key difference from a normal call to "exec()" is that
lexical scoping allows the class body (including any methods) to
reference names from the current and outer scopes when the class
definition occurs inside a function.

However, even when the class definition occurs inside the function,
methods defined inside the class still cannot see names defined at the
class scope. Class variables must be accessed through the first
parameter of instance or class methods, or through the implicit
lexically scoped "__class__" reference described in the next section.


Creating the class object
-------------------------

Once the class namespace has been populated by executing the class
body, the class object is created by calling "metaclass(name, bases,
namespace, **kwds)" (the additional keywords passed here are the same
as those passed to "__prepare__").

This class object is the one that will be referenced by the zero-
argument form of "super()". "__class__" is an implicit closure
reference created by the compiler if any methods in a class body refer
to either "__class__" or "super". This allows the zero argument form
of "super()" to correctly identify the class being defined based on
lexical scoping, while the class or instance that was used to make the
current call is identified based on the first argument passed to the
method.

**CPython implementation detail:** In CPython 3.6 and later, the
"__class__" cell is passed to the metaclass as a "__classcell__" entry
in the class namespace. If present, this must be propagated up to the
"type.__new__" call in order for the class to be initialised
correctly. Failing to do so will result in a "RuntimeError" in Python
3.8.

When using the default metaclass "type", or any metaclass that
ultimately calls "type.__new__", the following additional
customization steps are invoked after creating the class object:

1. The "type.__new__" method collects all of the attributes in the
   class namespace that define a "__set_name__()" method;

2. Those "__set_name__" methods are called with the class being
   defined and the assigned name of that particular attribute;

3. The "__init_subclass__()" hook is called on the immediate parent of
   the new class in its method resolution order.

After the class object is created, it is passed to the class
decorators included in the class definition (if any) and the resulting
object is bound in the local namespace as the defined class.

When a new class is created by "type.__new__", the object provided as
the namespace parameter is copied to a new ordered mapping and the
original object is discarded. The new copy is wrapped in a read-only
proxy, which becomes the "__dict__" attribute of the class object.

See also:

  **PEP 3135** - New super
     Describes the implicit "__class__" closure reference


Uses for metaclasses
--------------------

The potential uses for metaclasses are boundless. Some ideas that have
been explored include enum, logging, interface checking, automatic
delegation, automatic property creation, proxies, frameworks, and
automatic resource locking/synchronization.


Customizing instance and subclass checks
========================================

The following methods are used to override the default behavior of the
"isinstance()" and "issubclass()" built-in functions.

In particular, the metaclass "abc.ABCMeta" implements these methods in
order to allow the addition of Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) as
“virtual base classes” to any class or type (including built-in
types), including other ABCs.

type.__instancecheck__(self, instance)

   Return true if *instance* should be considered a (direct or
   indirect) instance of *class*. If defined, called to implement
   "isinstance(instance, class)".

type.__subclasscheck__(self, subclass)

   Return true if *subclass* should be considered a (direct or
   indirect) subclass of *class*.  If defined, called to implement
   "issubclass(subclass, class)".

Note that these methods are looked up on the type (metaclass) of a
class.  They cannot be defined as class methods in the actual class.
This is consistent with the lookup of special methods that are called
on instances, only in this case the instance is itself a class.

See also:

  **PEP 3119** - Introducing Abstract Base Classes
     Includes the specification for customizing "isinstance()" and
     "issubclass()" behavior through "__instancecheck__()" and
     "__subclasscheck__()", with motivation for this functionality in
     the context of adding Abstract Base Classes (see the "abc"
     module) to the language.


Emulating generic types
=======================

When using *type annotations*, it is often useful to *parameterize* a
*generic type* using Python’s square-brackets notation. For example,
the annotation "list[int]" might be used to signify a "list" in which
all the elements are of type "int".

  **PEP 484** - Type Hints

  Generic Alias Types
     Documentation for objects representing parameterized generic
     classes

  Generics, user-defined generics and "typing.Generic"
     Documentation on how to implement generic classes that can be
     parameterized at runtime and understood by static type-checkers.

A class can *generally* only be parameterized if it defines the
special class method "__class_getitem__()".

classmethod object.__class_getitem__(cls, key)

   Return an object representing the specialization of a generic class
   by type arguments found in *key*.

   When defined on a class, "__class_getitem__()" is automatically a
   class method. As such, there is no need for it to be decorated with
   "@classmethod" when it is defined.


The purpose of *__class_getitem__*
----------------------------------

The purpose of "__class_getitem__()" is to allow runtime
parameterization of standard-library generic classes in order to more
easily apply *type hints* to these classes.

To implement custom generic classes that can be parameterized at
runtime and understood by static type-checkers, users should either
inherit from a standard library class that already implements
"__class_getitem__()", or inherit from "typing.Generic", which has its
own implementation of "__class_getitem__()".

Custom implementations of "__class_getitem__()" on classes defined
outside of the standard library may not be understood by third-party
type-checkers such as mypy. Using "__class_getitem__()" on any class
for purposes other than type hinting is discouraged.


*__class_getitem__* versus *__getitem__*
----------------------------------------

Usually, the subscription of an object using square brackets will call
the "__getitem__()" instance method defined on the object’s class.
However, if the object being subscribed is itself a class, the class
method "__class_getitem__()" may be called instead.
"__class_getitem__()" should return a GenericAlias object if it is
properly defined.

Presented with the *expression* "obj[x]", the Python interpreter
follows something like the following process to decide whether
"__getitem__()" or "__class_getitem__()" should be called:

   from inspect import isclass

   def subscribe(obj, x):
       """Return the result of the expression 'obj[x]'"""

       class_of_obj = type(obj)

       # If the class of obj defines __getitem__,
       # call class_of_obj.__getitem__(obj, x)
       if hasattr(class_of_obj, '__getitem__'):
           return class_of_obj.__getitem__(obj, x)

       # Else, if obj is a class and defines __class_getitem__,
       # call obj.__class_getitem__(x)
       elif isclass(obj) and hasattr(obj, '__class_getitem__'):
           return obj.__class_getitem__(x)

       # Else, raise an exception
       else:
           raise TypeError(
               f"'{class_of_obj.__name__}' object is not subscriptable"
           )

In Python, all classes are themselves instances of other classes. The
class of a class is known as that class’s *metaclass*, and most
classes have the "type" class as their metaclass. "type" does not
define "__getitem__()", meaning that expressions such as "list[int]",
"dict[str, float]" and "tuple[str, bytes]" all result in
"__class_getitem__()" being called:

   >>> # list has class "type" as its metaclass, like most classes:
   >>> type(list)
   <class 'type'>
   >>> type(dict) == type(list) == type(tuple) == type(str) == type(bytes)
   True
   >>> # "list[int]" calls "list.__class_getitem__(int)"
   >>> list[int]
   list[int]
   >>> # list.__class_getitem__ returns a GenericAlias object:
   >>> type(list[int])
   <class 'types.GenericAlias'>

However, if a class has a custom metaclass that defines
"__getitem__()", subscribing the class may result in different
behaviour. An example of this can be found in the "enum" module:

   >>> from enum import Enum
   >>> class Menu(Enum):
   ...     """A breakfast menu"""
   ...     SPAM = 'spam'
   ...     BACON = 'bacon'
   ...
   >>> # Enum classes have a custom metaclass:
   >>> type(Menu)
   <class 'enum.EnumMeta'>
   >>> # EnumMeta defines __getitem__,
   >>> # so __class_getitem__ is not called,
   >>> # and the result is not a GenericAlias object:
   >>> Menu['SPAM']
   <Menu.SPAM: 'spam'>
   >>> type(Menu['SPAM'])
   <enum 'Menu'>

See also:

  **PEP 560** - Core Support for typing module and generic types
     Introducing "__class_getitem__()", and outlining when a
     subscription results in "__class_getitem__()" being called
     instead of "__getitem__()"


Emulating callable objects
==========================

object.__call__(self[, args...])

   Called when the instance is “called” as a function; if this method
   is defined, "x(arg1, arg2, ...)" roughly translates to
   "type(x).__call__(x, arg1, ...)". The "object" class itself does
   not provide this method.


Emulating container types
=========================

The following methods can be defined to implement container objects.
None of them are provided by the "object" class itself. Containers
usually are *sequences* (such as "lists" or "tuples") or *mappings*
(like *dictionaries*), but can represent other containers as well.
The first set of methods is used either to emulate a sequence or to
emulate a mapping; the difference is that for a sequence, the
allowable keys should be the integers *k* for which "0 <= k < N" where
*N* is the length of the sequence, or "slice" objects, which define a
range of items.  It is also recommended that mappings provide the
methods "keys()", "values()", "items()", "get()", "clear()",
"setdefault()", "pop()", "popitem()", "copy()", and "update()"
behaving similar to those for Python’s standard "dictionary" objects.
The "collections.abc" module provides a "MutableMapping" *abstract
base class* to help create those methods from a base set of
"__getitem__()", "__setitem__()", "__delitem__()", and "keys()".
Mutable sequences should provide methods "append()", "count()",
"index()", "extend()", "insert()", "pop()", "remove()", "reverse()"
and "sort()", like Python standard "list" objects. Finally, sequence
types should implement addition (meaning concatenation) and
multiplication (meaning repetition) by defining the methods
"__add__()", "__radd__()", "__iadd__()", "__mul__()", "__rmul__()" and
"__imul__()" described below; they should not define other numerical
operators.  It is recommended that both mappings and sequences
implement the "__contains__()" method to allow efficient use of the
"in" operator; for mappings, "in" should search the mapping’s keys;
for sequences, it should search through the values.  It is further
recommended that both mappings and sequences implement the
"__iter__()" method to allow efficient iteration through the
container; for mappings, "__iter__()" should iterate through the
object’s keys; for sequences, it should iterate through the values.

object.__len__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in function "len()".  Should return
   the length of the object, an integer ">=" 0.  Also, an object that
   doesn’t define a "__bool__()" method and whose "__len__()" method
   returns zero is considered to be false in a Boolean context.

   **CPython implementation detail:** In CPython, the length is
   required to be at most "sys.maxsize". If the length is larger than
   "sys.maxsize" some features (such as "len()") may raise
   "OverflowError".  To prevent raising "OverflowError" by truth value
   testing, an object must define a "__bool__()" method.

object.__length_hint__(self)

   Called to implement "operator.length_hint()". Should return an
   estimated length for the object (which may be greater or less than
   the actual length). The length must be an integer ">=" 0. The
   return value may also be "NotImplemented", which is treated the
   same as if the "__length_hint__" method didn’t exist at all. This
   method is purely an optimization and is never required for
   correctness.

   Added in version 3.4.

Note:

  Slicing is done exclusively with the following three methods.  A
  call like

     a[1:2] = b

  is translated to

     a[slice(1, 2, None)] = b

  and so forth.  Missing slice items are always filled in with "None".

object.__getitem__(self, key)

   Called to implement evaluation of "self[key]". For *sequence*
   types, the accepted keys should be integers. Optionally, they may
   support "slice" objects as well.  Negative index support is also
   optional. If *key* is of an inappropriate type, "TypeError" may be
   raised; if *key* is a value outside the set of indexes for the
   sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values),
   "IndexError" should be raised. For *mapping* types, if *key* is
   missing (not in the container), "KeyError" should be raised.

   Note:

     "for" loops expect that an "IndexError" will be raised for
     illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the
     sequence.

   Note:

     When subscripting a *class*, the special class method
     "__class_getitem__()" may be called instead of "__getitem__()".
     See __class_getitem__ versus __getitem__ for more details.

object.__setitem__(self, key, value)

   Called to implement assignment to "self[key]".  Same note as for
   "__getitem__()".  This should only be implemented for mappings if
   the objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys
   can be added, or for sequences if elements can be replaced.  The
   same exceptions should be raised for improper *key* values as for
   the "__getitem__()" method.

object.__delitem__(self, key)

   Called to implement deletion of "self[key]".  Same note as for
   "__getitem__()".  This should only be implemented for mappings if
   the objects support removal of keys, or for sequences if elements
   can be removed from the sequence.  The same exceptions should be
   raised for improper *key* values as for the "__getitem__()" method.

object.__missing__(self, key)

   Called by "dict"."__getitem__()" to implement "self[key]" for dict
   subclasses when key is not in the dictionary.

object.__iter__(self)

   This method is called when an *iterator* is required for a
   container. This method should return a new iterator object that can
   iterate over all the objects in the container.  For mappings, it
   should iterate over the keys of the container.

object.__reversed__(self)

   Called (if present) by the "reversed()" built-in to implement
   reverse iteration.  It should return a new iterator object that
   iterates over all the objects in the container in reverse order.

   If the "__reversed__()" method is not provided, the "reversed()"
   built-in will fall back to using the sequence protocol ("__len__()"
   and "__getitem__()").  Objects that support the sequence protocol
   should only provide "__reversed__()" if they can provide an
   implementation that is more efficient than the one provided by
   "reversed()".

The membership test operators ("in" and "not in") are normally
implemented as an iteration through a container. However, container
objects can supply the following special method with a more efficient
implementation, which also does not require the object be iterable.

object.__contains__(self, item)

   Called to implement membership test operators.  Should return true
   if *item* is in *self*, false otherwise.  For mapping objects, this
   should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or
   the key-item pairs.

   For objects that don’t define "__contains__()", the membership test
   first tries iteration via "__iter__()", then the old sequence
   iteration protocol via "__getitem__()", see this section in the
   language reference.


Emulating numeric types
=======================

The following methods can be defined to emulate numeric objects.
Methods corresponding to operations that are not supported by the
particular kind of number implemented (e.g., bitwise operations for
non-integral numbers) should be left undefined.

object.__add__(self, other)
object.__sub__(self, other)
object.__mul__(self, other)
object.__matmul__(self, other)
object.__truediv__(self, other)
object.__floordiv__(self, other)
object.__mod__(self, other)
object.__divmod__(self, other)
object.__pow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__lshift__(self, other)
object.__rshift__(self, other)
object.__and__(self, other)
object.__xor__(self, other)
object.__or__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic
   operations ("+", "-", "*", "@", "/", "//", "%", "divmod()",
   "pow()", "**", "<<", ">>", "&", "^", "|").  For instance, to
   evaluate the expression "x + y", where *x* is an instance of a
   class that has an "__add__()" method, "type(x).__add__(x, y)" is
   called.  The "__divmod__()" method should be the equivalent to
   using "__floordiv__()" and "__mod__()"; it should not be related to
   "__truediv__()".  Note that "__pow__()" should be defined to accept
   an optional third argument if the ternary version of the built-in
   "pow()" function is to be supported.

   If one of those methods does not support the operation with the
   supplied arguments, it should return "NotImplemented".

object.__radd__(self, other)
object.__rsub__(self, other)
object.__rmul__(self, other)
object.__rmatmul__(self, other)
object.__rtruediv__(self, other)
object.__rfloordiv__(self, other)
object.__rmod__(self, other)
object.__rdivmod__(self, other)
object.__rpow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__rlshift__(self, other)
object.__rrshift__(self, other)
object.__rand__(self, other)
object.__rxor__(self, other)
object.__ror__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic
   operations ("+", "-", "*", "@", "/", "//", "%", "divmod()",
   "pow()", "**", "<<", ">>", "&", "^", "|") with reflected (swapped)
   operands.  These functions are only called if the left operand does
   not support the corresponding operation [3] and the operands are of
   different types. [4] For instance, to evaluate the expression "x -
   y", where *y* is an instance of a class that has an "__rsub__()"
   method, "type(y).__rsub__(y, x)" is called if "type(x).__sub__(x,
   y)" returns "NotImplemented".

   Note that ternary "pow()" will not try calling "__rpow__()" (the
   coercion rules would become too complicated).

   Note:

     If the right operand’s type is a subclass of the left operand’s
     type and that subclass provides a different implementation of the
     reflected method for the operation, this method will be called
     before the left operand’s non-reflected method. This behavior
     allows subclasses to override their ancestors’ operations.

object.__iadd__(self, other)
object.__isub__(self, other)
object.__imul__(self, other)
object.__imatmul__(self, other)
object.__itruediv__(self, other)
object.__ifloordiv__(self, other)
object.__imod__(self, other)
object.__ipow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__ilshift__(self, other)
object.__irshift__(self, other)
object.__iand__(self, other)
object.__ixor__(self, other)
object.__ior__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic
   assignments ("+=", "-=", "*=", "@=", "/=", "//=", "%=", "**=",
   "<<=", ">>=", "&=", "^=", "|=").  These methods should attempt to
   do the operation in-place (modifying *self*) and return the result
   (which could be, but does not have to be, *self*).  If a specific
   method is not defined, or if that method returns "NotImplemented",
   the augmented assignment falls back to the normal methods.  For
   instance, if *x* is an instance of a class with an "__iadd__()"
   method, "x += y" is equivalent to "x = x.__iadd__(y)" . If
   "__iadd__()" does not exist, or if "x.__iadd__(y)" returns
   "NotImplemented", "x.__add__(y)" and "y.__radd__(x)" are
   considered, as with the evaluation of "x + y". In certain
   situations, augmented assignment can result in unexpected errors
   (see Why does a_tuple[i] += [‘item’] raise an exception when the
   addition works?), but this behavior is in fact part of the data
   model.

object.__neg__(self)
object.__pos__(self)
object.__abs__(self)
object.__invert__(self)

   Called to implement the unary arithmetic operations ("-", "+",
   "abs()" and "~").

object.__complex__(self)
object.__int__(self)
object.__float__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in functions "complex()", "int()" and
   "float()".  Should return a value of the appropriate type.

object.__index__(self)

   Called to implement "operator.index()", and whenever Python needs
   to losslessly convert the numeric object to an integer object (such
   as in slicing, or in the built-in "bin()", "hex()" and "oct()"
   functions). Presence of this method indicates that the numeric
   object is an integer type.  Must return an integer.

   If "__int__()", "__float__()" and "__complex__()" are not defined
   then corresponding built-in functions "int()", "float()" and
   "complex()" fall back to "__index__()".

object.__round__(self[, ndigits])
object.__trunc__(self)
object.__floor__(self)
object.__ceil__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in function "round()" and "math"
   functions "trunc()", "floor()" and "ceil()". Unless *ndigits* is
   passed to "__round__()" all these methods should return the value
   of the object truncated to an "Integral" (typically an "int").

   The built-in function "int()" falls back to "__trunc__()" if
   neither "__int__()" nor "__index__()" is defined.

   Changed in version 3.11: The delegation of "int()" to "__trunc__()"
   is deprecated.


With Statement Context Managers
===============================

A *context manager* is an object that defines the runtime context to
be established when executing a "with" statement. The context manager
handles the entry into, and the exit from, the desired runtime context
for the execution of the block of code.  Context managers are normally
invok
