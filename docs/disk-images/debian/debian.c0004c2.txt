      This is the protocol 0 version of protocol 1's OBJ opcode.
      INST is followed by two newline-terminated strings, giving a
      module and class name, just as for the GLOBAL opcode (and see
      GLOBAL for more details about that).  self.find_class(module, name)
      is used to get a class object.

      In addition, all the objects on the stack following the topmost
      markobject are gathered into a tuple and popped (along with the
      topmost markobject), just as for the TUPLE opcode.

      Now it gets complicated.  If all of these are true:

        + The argtuple is empty (markobject was at the top of the stack
          at the start).

        + The class object does not have a __getinitargs__ attribute.

      then we want to create an old-style class instance without invoking
      its __init__() method (pickle has waffled on this over the years; not
      calling __init__() is current wisdom).  In this case, an instance of
      an old-style dummy class is created, and then we try to rebind its
      __class__ attribute to the desired class object.  If this succeeds,
      the new instance object is pushed on the stack, and we're done.

      Else (the argtuple is not empty, it's not an old-style class object,
      or the class object does have a __getinitargs__ attribute), the code
      first insists that the class object have a __safe_for_unpickling__
      attribute.  Unlike as for the __safe_for_unpickling__ check in REDUCE,
      it doesn't matter whether this attribute has a true or false value, it
      only matters whether it exists (XXX this is a bug).  If
      __safe_for_unpickling__ doesn't exist, UnpicklingError is raised.

      Else (the class object does have a __safe_for_unpickling__ attr),
      the class object obtained from INST's arguments is applied to the
      argtuple obtained from the stack, and the resulting instance object
      is pushed on the stack.

      NOTE:  checks for __safe_for_unpickling__ went away in Python 2.3.

             not make sense in Python 3.

      This is the protocol 1 version of protocol 0's INST opcode, and is
      very much like it.  The major difference is that the class object
      is taken off the stack, allowing it to be retrieved from the memo
      repeatedly if several instances of the same class are created.  This
      can be much more efficient (in both time and space) than repeatedly
      embedding the module and class names in INST opcodes.

      Unlike INST, OBJ takes no arguments from the opcode stream.  Instead
      the class object is taken off the stack, immediately above the
      topmost markobject:

      Stack before: ... markobject classobject stackslice

      gathered into an argument tuple, and then the logic seems identical,

      a bug).  See INST for the gory details.

      NOTE:  In Python 2.3, INST and OBJ are identical except for how they

#
#    History:
#
#    <see CVS and SVN checkin messages for history>
#
#    1.0.8 - changed Windows support to read version from kernel32.dll
#    1.0.7 - added DEV_NULL
#    1.0.6 - added linux_distribution()
#    1.0.5 - fixed Java support to allow running the module on Jython
#    1.0.4 - added IronPython support
#    1.0.3 - added normalization of Windows system name
#    1.0.2 - added more Windows support
#    1.0.1 - reformatted to make doc.py happy
#    1.0.0 - reformatted a bit and checked into Python CVS
#    0.8.0 - added sys.version parser and various new access
#            APIs (python_version(), python_compiler(), etc.)
#    0.7.2 - fixed architecture() to use sizeof(pointer) where available
#    0.7.1 - added support for Caldera OpenLinux
#    0.7.0 - some fixes for WinCE; untabified the source file
#    0.6.2 - support for OpenVMS - requires version 1.5.2-V006 or higher and
#            vms_lib.getsyi() configured
#    0.6.1 - added code to prevent 'uname -p' on platforms which are
#            known not to support it
#    0.6.0 - fixed win32_ver() to hopefully work on Win95,98,NT and Win2k;
#            did some cleanup of the interfaces - some APIs have changed
#    0.5.5 - fixed another type in the MacOS code... should have
#            used more coffee today ;-)
#    0.5.4 - fixed a few typos in the MacOS code
#    0.5.3 - added experimental MacOS support; added better popen()
#            workarounds in _syscmd_ver() -- still not 100% elegant
#            though
#    0.5.2 - fixed uname() to return '' instead of 'unknown' in all
#            return values (the system uname command tends to return
#            'unknown' instead of just leaving the field empty)
#    0.5.1 - included code for slackware dist; added exception handlers
#            to cover up situations where platforms don't have os.popen
#            (e.g. Mac) or fail on socket.gethostname(); fixed libc
#            detection RE
#    0.5.0 - changed the API names referring to system commands to *syscmd*;
#            added java_ver(); made syscmd_ver() a private
#            API (was system_ver() in previous versions) -- use uname()
#            instead; extended the win32_ver() to also return processor
#            type information
#    0.4.0 - added win32_ver() and modified the platform() output for WinXX
#    0.3.4 - fixed a bug in _follow_symlinks()
#    0.3.3 - fixed popen() and "file" command invocation bugs
#    0.3.2 - added architecture() API and support for it in platform()
#    0.3.1 - fixed syscmd_ver() RE to support Windows NT
#    0.3.0 - added system alias support
#    0.2.3 - removed 'wince' again... oh well.
#    0.2.2 - added 'wince' to syscmd_ver() supported platforms
#    0.2.1 - added cache logic and changed the platform string format
#    0.2.0 - changed the API to use functions instead of module globals
#            since some action take too long to be run on module import
#    0.1.0 - first release

The property list (.plist) file format is a simple XML pickle supporting
basic object types, like dictionaries, lists, numbers and strings.
Usually the top level object is a dictionary.

To write out a plist file, use the dump(value, file)
function. 'value' is the top level object, 'file' is
a (writable) file object.

To parse a plist from a file, use the load(file) function,
with a (readable) file object as the only argument. It
returns the top level object (again, usually a dictionary).

To work with plist data in bytes objects, you can use loads()
and dumps().

Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, lists,
dictionaries (but only with string keys), Data, bytes, bytearray, or
datetime.datetime objects.

Generate Plist example:

    import datetime
    import plistlib

    pl = dict(
        aString = "Doodah",
        aList = ["A", "B", 12, 32.1, [1, 2, 3]],
        aFloat = 0.1,
        anInt = 728,
        aDict = dict(
            anotherString = "<hello & hi there!>",
            aThirdString = "M\xe4ssig, Ma\xdf",
            aTrueValue = True,
            aFalseValue = False,
        ),
        someData = b"<binary gunk>",
        someMoreData = b"<lots of binary gunk>" * 10,
        aDate = datetime.datetime.now()
    )
    print(plistlib.dumps(pl).decode())

Parse Plist example:

    import plistlib

    plist = b'''<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>foo</key>
        <string>bar</string>
    </dict>
    </plist>'''
    pl = plistlib.loads(plist)
    print(pl["foo"])
