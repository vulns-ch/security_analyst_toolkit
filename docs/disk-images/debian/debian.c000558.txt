#
# This file may provide defaults as well as options which needs to be
# synchronized between components.  As usual this file is read from
# the system wide config directory (e.g. /etc/gnupg/common.conf) as
# well as from the home directory (e.g. ~/.gnupg/common.conf).


# Uncomment to enable the use of the keybox daemon (keyboxd) by gpg
# and gpgsm.

# For testing ist is somethimes useful to use a different binary
# of keybox.  This option can be used to speicify this.
#keyboxd-program /foo/bar/keyboxd

# For the daemons (gpg-agent, scdaemon, dirmngr, keyboxd) it is often
# useful to define a shared logging destination.  This is either the

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# === The use of this feature is deprecated ===
# == Please use the more powerful global options. ==
#
# This file is read by gpgconf(1) to setup defaults for all or
# specified users and groups.  It may be used to change the hardwired
# defaults in gpgconf and to enforce certain values for the various
# GnuPG related configuration files.
#
# NOTE: This is a legacy mechanism.  The modern way is to use global
#       configuration files like /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf which are more
#       flexible and better integrated into the configuration system.
#
# Empty lines and comment lines, indicated by a hash mark as first non
# white space character, are ignored.  The line is separated by white
# space into fields. The first field is used to match the user or
# group and must start at the first column, the file is processed
# sequential until a matching rule is found.  A rule may contain
# several lines; continuation lines are indicated by a indenting them.
#
# Syntax of a line:
# <key>|WS  <component> <option> ["["<flag>"]"] [<value>]
#
# Examples for the <key> field:
#   foo         - Matches the user "foo".
#   foo:        - Matches the user "foo".
#   foo:staff   - Matches the user "foo" or the group "staff".
#   :staff      - Matches the group "staff".
#   *           - Matches any user.
# All other variants are not defined and reserved for future use.
#
# <component> and <option> are as specified by gpgconf.
# <flag> may be one of:
#   default     - Delete the option so that the default is used.
#   no-change   - Mark the field as non changeable by gpgconf.
#   change      - Mark the field as changeable by gpgconf.
#
# Example file:
#==========
# :staff  gpg-agent min-passphrase-len 6 [change]
#
# *       gpg-agent min-passphrase-len [no-change] 8
#         gpg-agent min-passphrase-nonalpha [no-change] 1
#         gpg-agent max-passphrase-days [no-change] 700
#         gpg-agent enable-passphrase-history [no-change]
#         gpg-agent enforce-passphrase-constraints [default]
#         gpg-agent enforce-passphrase-constraints [no-change]
#         gpg-agent max-cache-ttl [no-change] 10800
#         gpg-agent max-cache-ttl-ssh [no-change] 10800
#         gpgsm     enable-ocsp
#         gpg       compliance [no-change]
#         gpgsm     compliance [no-change]
#===========
# All users in the group "staff" are allowed to change the value for
# --allow-mark-trusted; gpgconf's default is not to allow a change
# through its interface.  When "gpgconf --apply-defaults" is used,
# "allow-mark-trusted" will get enabled and "min-passphrase-len" set
# to 6.  All other users are not allowed to change

# certificates.  They are defined as certificates capable of creating
# legally binding signatures in the same way as a handwritten
# signatures are.  Comments like this one and empty lines are allowed
# Lines do have a length limit but this is not a serious limitation as
# the format of the entries is fixed and checked by gpgsm: A
# non-comment line starts with optional whitespaces, followed by
# exactly 40 hex character, whitespace and a lowercased 2 letter
# country code.  Additional data delimited with by a whitespace is
# current ignored but might late be used for other purposes.
#
# Note: The subversion copy of this file carries a gpg:signature
# property with its OpenPGP signature.  Check this signature before
# adding entries:
#  svn pg gpg:signature qualified.txt | gpg --verify - qualified.txt
# to create a new signature:
#  f=qualified.txt; gpg -sba $f && svn ps gpg:signature -F $f.asc $f

# D-Trust root certificates.  Probably by shifting a lot of Euros to
# laywer companies, German CAs achieved to get the permission to
# create their own legally binding root certificates - independent of
# the Bundesnetzagentur.  The main problem with this is that it is
# hard to figure out what qualified root certificates are actually
# active.  There is now no way to be sure whether a signature is a
# qualified one.  A pettifogger's way of validating certificates.

Usage: $PGM [options]
$PGM is called by scdaemon on card reader status changes

Options:
  --reader-port N        Reports change for port N
  --old-code 0xNNNN      Previous status code
  --old-code 0xNNNN      Current status code
  --status USABLE|ACTIVE|PRESENT|NOCARD 
                         Human readable status code

Environment:

GNUPGHOME=DIR            Set to the active homedir

dirmngr and gpg-agent with systemd
===================================================

When used on a GNU/Linux system supervised by systemd, you can ensure
that the GnuPG daemons dirmngr and gpg-agent are launched
automatically the first time they're needed, and shut down cleanly at
session logout.  This is done by enabling user services via
socket-activation.

System distributors
-------------------

The *.service and *.socket files (from this directory) should be
placed in /usr/lib/systemd/user/ alongside other user-session services
and sockets.

To enable socket-activated dirmngr for all accounts on the system,
use:

    systemctl --user --global enable dirmngr.socket

To enable socket-activated gpg-agent for all accounts on the system,
use:

    systemctl --user --global enable gpg-agent.socket

Additionally, you can enable socket-activated gpg-agent ssh-agent
emulation for all accounts on the system with:

    systemctl --user --global enable gpg-agent-ssh.socket

You can also enable restricted ("--extra-socket"-style) gpg-agent
sockets for all accounts on the system with:

    systemctl --user --global enable gpg-agent-extra.socket

Individual users
----------------

A user on a system with systemd where this has not been installed
system-wide can place these files in ~/.config/systemd/user/ to make
them available.

If a given service isn't installed system-wide, or if it's installed
system-wide but not globally enabled, individual users will still need
to enable them.  For example, to enable socket-activated dirmngr for
all future sessions:

    systemctl --user enable dirmngr.socket

To enable socket-activated gpg-agent with ssh support, do:

    systemctl --user enable gpg-agent.socket gpg-agent-ssh.socket

These changes won't take effect until your next login after you've
fully logged out (be sure to terminate any running daemons before
logging out).

If you'd rather try a socket-activated GnuPG daemon in an
already-running session without logging out (with or without enabling
it for all future sessions), kill any existing daemon and start the
user socket directly.  For example, to set up socket-activated dirmgnr
in the current session:

    gpgconf --kill dirmngr
    systemctl --user start dirmngr.socket

Comment lines, like this
# one, as well as empty lines are ignored.  Lines have a length limit
# but this is not serious limitation as the format of the entries is
# fixed and checked by gpg-agent.  A non-comment line starts with
# optional white space, followed by the SHA-1 fingerpint in hex,
# optionally followed by a flag character which my either be 'P', 'S'
# or '*'.  This file will be read by gpg-agent if no local trustlist
# is available or if the statement "include-default" is used in the
# local list. You should give the gpg-agent(s) a HUP after editing
# this file.
