      Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
      - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
        between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
        version is still 5 times faster, though.
      - Arguments more compliant with python standard

Licenses for Software linked to
===============================

Note that the choice of GPL compatibility outlined above doesn't extend
to modules linked to particular libraries, since they change the
effective License of the module binary.


GNU Readline
------------

The 'readline' module makes use of GNU Readline.

      The GNU Readline Library is free software; you can redistribute it
      and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at
      your option) any later version.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete statement in
      /usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright'. A copy of the GNU General
      Public License is available in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.


OpenSSL
-------

The '_ssl' module makes use of OpenSSL.

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the
      conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license
      apply to the toolkit. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open
      Source licenses. Note that both licenses are incompatible with
      the GPL.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete license text in
      /usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright'.
