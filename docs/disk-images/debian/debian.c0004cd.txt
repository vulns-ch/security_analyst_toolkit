rn a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the
   dictionary. The view will be iterated in reverse order of the
   insertion.

   Changed in version 3.8: Dictionary views are now reversible.

dictview.mapping

   Return a "types.MappingProxyType" that wraps the original
   dictionary to which the view refers.

   Added in version 3.10.

Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and *hashable*.
Items views also have set-like operations since the (key, value) pairs
are unique and the keys are hashable. If all values in an items view
are hashable as well, then the items view can interoperate with other
sets. (Values views are not treated as set-like since the entries are
generally not unique.)  For set-like views, all of the operations
defined for the abstract base class "collections.abc.Set" are
available (for example, "==", "<", or "^").  While using set
operators, set-like views accept any iterable as the other operand,
unlike sets which only accept sets as the input.

An example of dictionary view usage:

   >>> dishes = {'eggs': 2, 'sausage': 1, 'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}
   >>> keys = dishes.keys()
   >>> values = dishes.values()

   >>> # iteration
   >>> n = 0
   >>> for val in values:
   ...     n += val
   ...
   >>> print(n)
   504

   >>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order)
   >>> list(keys)
   ['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam']
   >>> list(values)
   [2, 1, 1, 500]

   >>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes
   >>> del dishes['eggs']
   >>> del dishes['sausage']
   >>> list(keys)
   ['bacon', 'spam']

   >>> # set operations
   >>> keys & {'eggs', 'bacon', 'salad'}
   {'bacon'}
   >>> keys ^ {'sausage', 'juice'} == {'juice', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'}
   True
   >>> keys | ['juice', 'juice', 'juice'] == {'bacon', 'spam', 'juice'}
   True

   >>> # get back a read-only proxy for the original dictionary
   >>> values.mapping
   mappingproxy({'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500})
   >>> values.mapping['spam']
   500

    'typesmethods': r'''Methods
*******

Methods are functions that are called using the attribute notation.
There are two flavors: built-in methods (such as "append()" on lists)
and class instance method. Built-in methods are described with the
types that support them.

If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace)
through an instance, you get a special object: a *bound method* (also
called instance method) object. When called, it will add the "self"
argument to the argument list.  Bound methods have two special read-
only attributes: "m.__self__" is the object on which the method
operates, and "m.__func__" is the function implementing the method.
Calling "m(arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n)" is completely equivalent to
calling "m.__func__(m.__self__, arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n)".

Like function objects, bound method objects support getting arbitrary
attributes.  However, since method attributes are actually stored on
the underlying function object ("method.__func__"), setting method
attributes on bound methods is disallowed.  Attempting to set an
attribute on a method results in an "AttributeError" being raised.  In
order to set a method attribute, you need to explicitly set it on the
underlying function object:

   >>> class C:
   ...     def method(self):
   ...         pass
   ...
   >>> c = C()
   >>> c.method.whoami = 'my name is method'  # can't set on the method
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   AttributeError: 'method' object has no attribute 'whoami'
   >>> c.method.__func__.whoami = 'my name is method'
   >>> c.method.whoami
   'my name is method'

See Instance methods for more information.
''',
    'typesmodules': r'''Modules
*******

The only special operation on a module is attribute access: "m.name",
where *m* is a module and *name* accesses a name defined in *m*’s
symbol table. Module attributes can be assigned to.  (Note that the
"import" statement is not, strictly speaking, an operation on a module
object; "import foo" does not require a module object named *foo* to
exist, rather it requires an (external) *definition* for a module
named *foo* somewhere.)

A special attribute of every module is "__dict__". This is the
dictionary containing the module’s symbol table. Modifying this
dictionary will actually change the module’s symbol table, but direct
assignment to the "__dict__" attribute is not possible (you can write
"m.__dict__['a'] = 1", which defines "m.a" to be "1", but you can’t
write "m.__dict__ = {}").  Modifying "__dict__" directly is not
recommended.

Modules built into the interpreter are written like this: "<module
'sys' (built-in)>".  If loaded from a file, they are written as
"<module 'os' from '/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/os.pyc'>".

    'typesseq': r'''Sequence Types — "list", "tuple", "range"
*****************************************

There are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range
objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary
data and text strings are described in dedicated sections.


Common Sequence Operations
==========================

The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence
types, both mutable and immutable. The "collections.abc.Sequence" ABC
is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations
on custom sequence types.

This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority.
In the table, *s* and *t* are sequences of the same type, *n*, *i*,
*j* and *k* are integers and *x* is an arbitrary object that meets any
type and value restrictions imposed by *s*.

The "in" and "not in" operations have the same priorities as the
comparison operations. The "+" (concatenation) and "*" (repetition)
operations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric
operations. [3]

+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| Operation                  | Result                           | Notes      |
|============================|==================================|============|
| "x in s"                   | "True" if an item of *s* is      | (1)        |
|                            | equal to *x*, else "False"       |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "x not in s"               | "False" if an item of *s* is     | (1)        |
|                            | equal to *x*, else "True"        |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s + t"                    | the concatenation of *s* and *t* | (6)(7)     |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s * n" or "n * s"         | equivalent to adding *s* to      | (2)(7)     |
|                            | itself *n* times                 |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s[i]"                     | *i*th item of *s*, origin 0      | (3)(9)     |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s[i:j]"                   | slice of *s* from *i* to *j*     | (3)(4)     |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s[i:j:k]"                 | slice of *s* from *i* to *j*     | (3)(5)     |
|                            | with step *k*                    |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+

+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "min(s)"                   | smallest item of *s*             |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "max(s)"                   | largest item of *s*              |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s.index(x[, i[, j]])"     | index of the first occurrence of | (8)        |
|                            | *x* in *s* (at or after index    |            |
|                            | *i* and before index *j*)        |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "s.count(x)"               | total number of occurrences of   |            |
|                            | *x* in *s*                       |            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+

Sequences of the same type also support comparisons.  In particular,
tuples and lists are compared lexicographically by comparing
corresponding elements. This means that to compare equal, every
element must compare equal and the two sequences must be of the same
type and have the same length.  (For full details see Comparisons in
the language reference.)

Forward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values
using an index.  That index will continue to march forward (or
backward) even if the underlying sequence is mutated.  The iterator
terminates only when an "IndexError" or a "StopIteration" is
encountered (or when the index drops below zero).

Notes:

1. While the "in" and "not in" operations are used only for simple
   containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences
   (such as "str", "bytes" and "bytearray") also use them for
   subsequence testing:

      >>> "gg" in "eggs"
      True

2. Values of *n* less than "0" are treated as "0" (which yields an
   empty sequence of the same type as *s*).  Note that items in the
   sequence *s* are not copied; they are referenced multiple times.
   This often haunts new Python programmers; consider:

      >>> lists = [[]] * 3
      >>> lists
      [[], [], []]
      >>> lists[0].append(3)
      >>> lists
      [[3], [3], [3]]

   What has happened is that "[[]]" is a one-element list containing
   an empty list, so all three elements of "[[]] * 3" are references
   to this single empty list.  Modifying any of the elements of
   "lists" modifies this single list. You can create a list of
   different lists this way:

      >>> lists = [[] for i in range(3)]
      >>> lists[0].append(3)
      >>> lists[1].append(5)
      >>> lists[2].append(7)
      >>> lists
      [[3], [5], [7]]

   Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a
   multidimensional list?.

3. If *i* or *j* is negative, the index is relative to the end of
   sequence *s*: "len(s) + i" or "len(s) + j" is substituted.  But
   note that "-0" is still "0".

4. The slice of *s* from *i* to *j* is defined as the sequence of
   items with index *k* such that "i <= k < j".  If *i* or *j* is
   greater than "len(s)", use "len(s)".  If *i* is omitted or "None",
   use "0".  If *j* is omitted or "None", use "len(s)".  If *i* is
   greater than or equal to *j*, the slice is empty.

5. The slice of *s* from *i* to *j* with step *k* is defined as the
   sequence of items with index  "x = i + n*k" such that "0 <= n <
   (j-i)/k".  In other words, the indices are "i", "i+k", "i+2*k",
   "i+3*k" and so on, stopping when *j* is reached (but never
   including *j*).  When *k* is positive, *i* and *j* are reduced to
   "len(s)" if they are greater. When *k* is negative, *i* and *j* are
   reduced to "len(s) - 1" if they are greater.  If *i* or *j* are
   omitted or "None", they become “end” values (which end depends on
   the sign of *k*).  Note, *k* cannot be zero. If *k* is "None", it
   is treated like "1".

6. Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object.
   This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation
   will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length.
   To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the
   alternatives below:

   * if concatenating "str" objects, you can build a list and use
     "str.join()" at the end or else write to an "io.StringIO"
     instance and retrieve its value when complete

   * if concatenating "bytes" objects, you can similarly use
     "bytes.join()" or "io.BytesIO", or you can do in-place
     concatenation with a "bytearray" object.  "bytearray" objects are
     mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism

   * if concatenating "tuple" objects, extend a "list" instead

   * for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation

7. Some sequence types (such as "range") only support item sequences
   that follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence
   concatenation or repetition.

8. "index" raises "ValueError" when *x* is not found in *s*. Not all
   implementations support passing the additional arguments *i* and
   *j*. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of
   the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to
   using "s[i:j].index(x)", only without copying any data and with the
   returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather
   than the start of the slice.

9. An "IndexError" is raised if *i* is outside the sequence range.


Immutable Sequence Types
========================

The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement
that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for
the "hash()" built-in.

This support allows immutable sequences, such as "tuple" instances, to
be used as "dict" keys and stored in "set" and "frozenset" instances.

Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable
values will result in "TypeError".


Mutable Sequence Types
======================

The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence
types. The "collections.abc.MutableSequence" ABC is provided to make
it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence
types.

In the table *s* is an instance of a mutable sequence type, *t* is any
iterable object and *x* is an arbitrary object that meets any type and
value restrictions imposed by *s* (for example, "bytearray" only
accepts integers that meet the value restriction "0 <= x <= 255").

Notes:

1. If *k* is not equal to "1", *t* must have the same length as the
   slice it is replacing.

2. The optional argument *i* defaults to "-1", so that by default the
   last item is removed and returned.

3. "remove()" raises "ValueError" when *x* is not found in *s*.

4. The "reverse()" method modifies the sequence in place for economy
   of space when reversing a large sequence.  To remind users that it
   operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.

5. "clear()" and "copy()" are included for consistency with the
   interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing
   operations (such as "dict" and "set"). "copy()" is not part of the
   "collections.abc.MutableSequence" ABC, but most concrete mutable
   sequence classes provide it.

   Added in version 3.3: "clear()" and "copy()" methods.

6. The value *n* is an integer, or an object implementing
   "__index__()".  Zero and negative values of *n* clear the sequence.
   Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple
   times, as explained for "s * n" under Common Sequence Operations.


Lists
=====

Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by
application).

class list([iterable])

   Lists may be constructed in several ways:

   * Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: "[]"

   * Using square brackets, separating items with commas: "[a]", "[a,
     b, c]"

   * Using a list comprehension: "[x for x in iterable]"

   * Using the type constructor: "list()" or "list(iterable)"

   The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the
   same order as *iterable*’s items.  *iterable* may be either a
   sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator
   object.  If *iterable* is already a list, a copy is made and
   returned, similar to "iterable[:]". For example, "list('abc')"
   returns "['a', 'b', 'c']" and "list( (1, 2, 3) )" returns "[1, 2,
   3]". If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty
   list, "[]".

   Many other operations also produce lists, including the "sorted()"
   built-in.

   Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations.
   Lists also provide the following additional method:

   sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)

      This method sorts the list in place, using only "<" comparisons
      between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison
      operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the
      list will likely be left in a partially modified state).

      "sort()" accepts two arguments that can only be passed by
      keyword (keyword-only arguments):

      *key* specifies a function of one argument that is used to
      extract a comparison key from each list element (for example,
      "key=str.lower"). The key corresponding to each item in the list
      is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process.
      The default value of "None" means that list items are sorted
      directly without calculating a separate key value.

      The "functools.cmp_to_key()" utility is available to convert a
      2.x style *cmp* function to a *key* function.

      *reverse* is a boolean value.  If set to "True", then the list
      elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed.

      This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space
      when sorting a large sequence.  To remind users that it operates
      by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use
      "sorted()" to explicitly request a new sorted list instance).

      The "sort()" method is guaranteed to be stable.  A sort is
      stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of
      elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in
      multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary
      grade).

      For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting
      Techniques.

      **CPython implementation detail:** While a list is being sorted,
      the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is
      undefined.  The C implementation of Python makes the list appear
      empty for the duration, and raises "ValueError" if it can detect
      that the list has been mutated during a sort.


Tuples
======

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the "enumerate()"
built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence
of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a "set" or
"dict" instance).

class tuple([iterable])

   Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

   * Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: "()"

   * Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: "a," or "(a,)"

   * Separating items with commas: "a, b, c" or "(a, b, c)"

   * Using the "tuple()" built-in: "tuple()" or "tuple(iterable)"

   The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the
   same order as *iterable*’s items.  *iterable* may be either a
   sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator
   object.  If *iterable* is already a tuple, it is returned
   unchanged. For example, "tuple('abc')" returns "('a', 'b', 'c')"
   and "tuple( [1, 2, 3] )" returns "(1, 2, 3)". If no argument is
   given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, "()".

   Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the
   parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty
   tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity.
   For example, "f(a, b, c)" is a function call with three arguments,
   while "f((a, b, c))" is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole
   argument.

   Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations.

For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer
than access by index, "collections.namedtuple()" may be a more
appropriate choice than a simple tuple object.


Ranges
======

The "range" type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is
commonly used for looping a specific number of times in "for" loops.

class range(stop)
class range(start, stop[, step])

   The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either
   built-in "int" or any object that implements the "__index__()"
   special method).  If the *step* argument is omitted, it defaults to
   "1". If the *start* argument is omitted, it defaults to "0". If
   *step* is zero, "ValueError" is raised.

   For a positive *step*, the contents of a range "r" are determined
   by the formula "r[i] = start + step*i" where "i >= 0" and "r[i] <
   stop".

   For a negative *step*, the contents of the range are still
   determined by the formula "r[i] = start + step*i", but the
   constraints are "i >= 0" and "r[i] > stop".

   A range object will be empty if "r[0]" does not meet the value
   constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are
   interpreted as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by
   the positive indices.

   Ranges containing absolute values larger than "sys.maxsize" are
   permitted but some features (such as "len()") may raise
   "OverflowError".

   Range examples:

      >>> list(range(10))
      [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
      >>> list(range(1, 11))
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
      >>> list(range(0, 30, 5))
      [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
      >>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
      [0, 3, 6, 9]
      >>> list(range(0, -10, -1))
      [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
      >>> list(range(0))
      []
      >>> list(range(1, 0))
      []

   Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except
   concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects
   can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and
   repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern).

   start

      The value of the *start* parameter (or "0" if the parameter was
      not supplied)

   stop

      The value of the *stop* parameter

   step

      The value of the *step* parameter (or "1" if the parameter was
      not supplied)

The advantage of the "range" type over a regular "list" or "tuple" is
that a "range" object will always take the same (small) amount of
memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only
stores the "start", "stop" and "step" values, calculating individual
items and subranges as needed).

Range objects implement the "collections.abc.Sequence" ABC, and
provide features such as containment tests, element index lookup,
slicing and support for negative indices (see Sequence Types — list,
tuple, range):

>>> r = range(0, 20, 2)
>>> r
range(0, 20, 2)
>>> 11 in r
False
>>> 10 in r
True
>>> r.index(10)
5
>>> r[5]
10
>>> r[:5]
range(0, 10, 2)
>>> r[-1]
18

Testing range objects for equality with "==" and "!=" compares them as
sequences.  That is, two range objects are considered equal if they
represent the same sequence of values.  (Note that two range objects
that compare equal might have different "start", "stop" and "step"
attributes, for example "range(0) == range(2, 1, 3)" or "range(0, 3,
2) == range(0, 4, 2)".)

Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing
and negative indices. Test "int" objects for membership in constant
time instead of iterating through all items.

Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects
based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing
based on object identity).Added the "start", "stop" and "step"
attributes.

  * The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range
    suitable for floating-point applications.

    'typesseq-mutable': r'''Mutable Sequence Types
**********************

The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence
types. The "collections.abc.MutableSequence" ABC is provided to make
it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence
types.

In the table *s* is an instance of a mutable sequence type, *t* is any
iterable object and *x* is an arbitrary object that meets any type and
value restrictions imposed by *s* (for example, "bytearray" only
accepts integers that meet the value restriction "0 <= x <= 255").

Notes:

1. If *k* is not equal to "1", *t* must have the same length as the
   slice it is replacing.

2. The optional argument *i* defaults to "-1", so that by default the
   last item is removed and returned.

3. "remove()" raises "ValueError" when *x* is not found in *s*.

4. The "reverse()" method modifies the sequence in place for economy
   of space when reversing a large sequence.  To remind users that it
   operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.

5. "clear()" and "copy()" are included for consistency with the
   interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing
   operations (such as "dict" and "set"). "copy()" is not part of the
   "collections.abc.MutableSequence" ABC, but most concrete mutable
   sequence classes provide it.

   Added in version 3.3: "clear()" and "copy()" methods.

6. The value *n* is an integer, or an object implementing
   "__index__()".  Zero and negative values of *n* clear the sequence.
   Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple
   times, as explained for "s * n" under Common Sequence Operations.
''',
    'unary': r'''Unary arithmetic and bitwise operations
***************************************

All unary arithmetic and bitwise operations have the same priority:

   u_expr ::= power | "-" u_expr | "+" u_expr | "~" u_expr

The unary "-" (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric
argument; the operation can be overridden with the "__neg__()" special
method.

The unary "+" (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged;
the operation can be overridden with the "__pos__()" special method.

The unary "~" (invert) operator yields the bitwise inversion of its
integer argument.  The bitwise inversion of "x" is defined as
"-(x+1)".  It only applies to integral numbers or to custom objects
that override the "__invert__()" special method.

In all three cases, if the argument does not have the proper type, a
"TypeError" exception is raised.
''',
    'while': r'''The "while" statement
*********************

The "while" statement is used for repeated execution as long as an
expression is true:

   while_stmt ::= "while" assignment_expression ":" suite
                  ["else" ":" suite]

This repeatedly tests the expression and, if it is true, executes the
first suite; if the expression is false (which may be the first time
it is tested) the suite of the "else" clause, if present, is executed
and the loop terminates.

A "break" statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop
without executing the "else" clause’s suite.  A "continue" statement
executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and goes back
to testing the expression.
''',
    'with': r'''The "with" statement
********************

The "with" statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with
methods defined by a context manager (see section With Statement
Context Managers). This allows common "try"…"except"…"finally" usage
patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.

   with_stmt          ::= "with" ( "(" with_stmt_contents ","? ")" | with_stmt_contents ) ":" suite
   with_stmt_contents ::= with_item ("," with_item)*
   with_item          ::= expression ["as" target]

The execution of the "with" statement with one “item” proceeds as
follows:

1. The context expression (the expression given in the "with_item") is
   evaluated to obtain a context manager.

2. The context manager’s "__enter__()" is loaded for later use.

3. The context manager’s "__exit__()" is loaded for later use.

4. The context manager’s "__enter__()" method is invoked.

5. If a target was included in the "with" statement, the return value
   from "__enter__()" is assigned to it.

   Note:

     The "with" statement guarantees that if the "__enter__()" method
     returns without an error, then "__exit__()" will always be
     called. Thus, if an error occurs during the assignment to the
     target list, it will be treated the same as an error occurring
     within the suite would be. See step 7 below.

6. The suite is executed.

7. The context manager’s "__exit__()" method is invoked.  If an
   exception caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and
   traceback are passed as arguments to "__exit__()". Otherwise, three
   "None" arguments are supplied.

   If the suite was exited due to an exception, and the return value
   from the "__exit__()" method was false, the exception is reraised.
   If the return value was true, the exception is suppressed, and
   execution continues with the statement following the "with"
   statement.

   If the suite was exited for any reason other than an exception, the
   return value from "__exit__()" is ignored, and execution proceeds
   at the normal location for the kind of exit that was taken.

The following code:

   with EXPRESSION as TARGET:
       SUITE

is semantically equivalent to:

   manager = (EXPRESSION)
   enter = type(manager).__enter__
   exit = type(manager).__exit__
   value = enter(manager)
   hit_except = False

   try:
       TARGET = value
       SUITE
   except:
       hit_except = True
       if not exit(manager, *sys.exc_info()):
           raise
   finally:
       if not hit_except:
           exit(manager, None, None, None)

With more than one item, the context managers are processed as if
multiple "with" statements were nested:

   with A() as a, B() as b:
       SUITE

is semantically equivalent to:

   with A() as a:
       with B() as b:
           SUITE

You can also write multi-item context managers in multiple lines if
the items are surrounded by parentheses. For example:

   with (
       A() as a,
       B() as b,
   ):
       SUITE

Changed in version 3.1: Support for multiple context expressions.

Changed in version 3.10: Support for using grouping parentheses to
break the statement in multiple lines.

See also:

  **PEP 343** - The “with” statement
     The specification, background, and examples for the Python "with"
     statement.
''',
    'yield': r'''The "yield" statement
*********************

   yield_stmt ::= yield_expression

A "yield" statement is semantically equivalent to a yield expression.
The "yield" statement can be used to omit the parentheses that would
otherwise be required in the equivalent yield expression statement.
For example, the yield statements

   yield <expr>
   yield from <expr>

are equivalent to the yield expression statements

   (yield <expr>)
   (yield from <expr>)

Yield expressions and statements are only used when defining a
*generator* function, and are only used in the body of the generator
function.  Using "yield" in a function definition is sufficient to
cause that definition to create a generator function instead of a
normal function.

For full details of "yield" semantics, refer to the Yield expressions
section.

        shutdown(immediate=True) calls task_done() for each remaining item in
        the queue.

General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:

* The period is 2**19937-1.
* It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
* The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
  and is, therefore, threadsafe.

        samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
        into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).

        Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the

This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to
those found in Perl.  It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both
the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and
characters outside the US ASCII range.

Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.
Most ordinary characters, like "A", "a", or "0", are the simplest
regular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can
concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.

The special characters are:
    "."      Matches any character except a newline.
    "^"      Matches the start of the string.
    "$"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at
             the end of the string.
    "*"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
             Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.
    "+"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
    "?"      Matches 0 or 1 (greedy) of the preceding RE.
    *?,+?,?? Non-greedy versions of the previous three special characters.
    {m,n}    Matches from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE.
    {m,n}?   Non-greedy version of the above.
    "\\"     Either escapes special characters or signals a special sequence.
    []       Indicates a set of characters.
             A "^" as the first character indicates a complementing set.
    "|"      A|B, creates an RE that will match either A or B.
    (...)    Matches the RE inside the parentheses.
             The contents can be retrieved or matched later in the string.
    (?aiLmsux) The letters set the corresponding flags defined below.
    (?:...)  Non-grouping version of regular parentheses.
    (?P<name>...) The substring matched by the group is accessible by name.
    (?P=name)     Matches the text matched earlier by the group named name.
    (?#...)  A comment; ignored.
    (?=...)  Matches if ... matches next, but doesn't consume the string.
    (?!...)  Matches if ... doesn't match next.
    (?<=...) Matches if preceded by ... (must be fixed length).
    (?<!...) Matches if not preceded by ... (must be fixed length).
    (?(id/name)yes|no) Matches yes pattern if the group with id/name matched,
                       the (optional) no pattern otherwise.

The special sequences consist of "\\" and a character from the list
below.  If the ordinary character is not on the list, then the
resulting RE will match the second character.
    \number  Matches the contents of the group of the same number.
    \A       Matches only at the start of the string.
    \Z       Matches only at the end of the string.
    \b       Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.
    \B       Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.
    \d       Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9] in
             bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the whole
             range of Unicode digits.
    \D       Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to [^\d].
    \s       Matches any whitespace character; equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v] in
             bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the whole
             range of Unicode whitespace characters.
    \S       Matches any non-whitespace character; equivalent to [^\s].
    \w       Matches any alphanumeric character; equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]
             in bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the
             range of Unicode alphanumeric characters (letters plus digits
             plus underscore).
             With LOCALE, it will match the set [0-9_] plus characters defined
             as letters for the current locale.
    \W       Matches the complement of \w.
    \\       Matches a literal backslash.

This module exports the following functions:
    match     Match a regular expression pattern to the beginning of a string.
    fullmatch Match a regular expression pattern to all of a string.
    search    Search a string for the presence of a pattern.
    sub       Substitute occurrences of a pattern found in a string.
    subn      Same as sub, but also return the number of substitutions made.
    split     Split a string by the occurrences of a pattern.
    findall   Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
    finditer  Return an iterator yielding a Match object for each match.
    compile   Compile a pattern into a Pattern object.
    purge     Clear the regular expression cache.
    escape    Backslash all non-alphanumerics in a string.

Each function other than purge and escape can take an optional 'flags' argument
consisting of one or more of the following module constants, joined by "|".
A, L, and U are mutually exclusive.
    A  ASCII       For string patterns, make \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D
                   match the corresponding ASCII character categories
                   (rather than the whole Unicode categories, which is the
                   default).
                   For bytes patterns, this flag is the only available
                   behaviour and needn't be specified.
    I  IGNORECASE  Perform case-insensitive matching.
    L  LOCALE      Make \w, \W, \b, \B, dependent on the current locale.
    M  MULTILINE   "^" matches the beginning of lines (after a newline)
                   as well as the string.
                   "$" matches the end of lines (before a newline) as well
                   as the end of the string.
    S  DOTALL      "." matches any character at all, including the newline.
    X  VERBOSE     Ignore whitespace and comments for nicer looking RE's.
    U  UNICODE     For compatibility only. Ignored for string patterns (it
                   is the default), and forbidden for bytes patterns.

This module also defines exception 'PatternError', aliased to 'error' for
backward compatibility.
