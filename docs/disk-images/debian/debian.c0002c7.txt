All
deprecated utils are in maintenance mode and we keep them in source tree for
backward compatibility only.


what:  column --table-empty-lines
why:   renamed to --keep-empty-lines
since: v2.37

--------------------------

what:  hwclock --debug
why:   renamed to --verbose, and may be repurposed later.
since: v2.32

--------------------------

what:  hwclock -v for version
why:   renamed to -V
since: v2.20 (was repurposed to verbose in v2.32)

--------------------------

what:  column --columns
why:   renamed to --output-width
since: v2.30

--------------------------

what:  sfdisk --show-size
why:   this does not belong to fdisk, use "blockdev --getsz"

--------------------------

what:   sfdisk --Linux
why:    unnecessary option, only Linux (non-DOS mode) is supported

--------------------------

what:   sfdisk --unit
why:    unnecessary option, only 'S'ector unit is supported

--------------------------

what:   sfdisk --show-pt-geometry
why:    equal to --show-geometry for a long time

--------------------------

what:  "swapon --summary" output format
why:   does not provide control on output data formatting. The recommended solution
       is to use --show=<columns> in all scripts.

--------------------------

What:   mkfs
Why:    use filesystem specific mkfs.<type>.

--------------------------

What:   fdisk -s <device>
Why:    this does not belong to fdisk, use "blockdev --getsz"

--------------------------

What:   'udev' and 'list' blkid(8) output formats
Why:    udevd links libblkid directly; the 'list' is unnecessary, use lsblk(8)

--------------------------

What:   line(1) command
Why:    use the read(1) command

--------------------------

What:   pg(1) command
Why:    use less(1) or more(1)

--------------------------

What:   CHS stuff in fdisk (except SUN where are partitions addresses by cylinders only)
Why:    use addressing by sectors, CHS does not work with modern disks,
        confusing for users...

--------------------------

What:	losetup -s
Why:	the option -s is in collision with the Loop-AES losetup dialect that is used
        in some distributions. Use the long version (--show) only.

--------------------------

What:   losetup output format without --list

        deprecated format:

          # losetup -a
          /dev/loop0: []: (/home/fs-images/swap.img)
          /dev/loop1: []: (/home/fs-images/disk.img), offset 100

	new format:

          # losetup
          NAME       SIZELIMIT OFFSET AUTOCLEAR RO BACK-FILE
          /dev/loop0         0      0         0  0 /home/fs-images/swap.img
          /dev/loop1         0    100         0  0 /home/fs-images/disk.img

--------------------------

What:	tunelp
Why:	parallel port printers are probably almost extinct devices

# Option c, no argument
# Option c, argument 'more'
# Option b, argument ' very long '

PREFACE

Getopt(1) is a program to help shell scripts parse command-line parameters.

HIGHLIGHTS

It can do anything that the GNU getopt(3) routines can do.

It can cope with spaces and shell metacharacters within arguments.

It can parse long parameters.

It can shuffle parameters, so you can mix options and other parameters on
the command-line.

It can be easily identified as an enhanced getopt(1) from within shell scripts.

It can report parse errors as coming from the shell script.

It is fully compatible with other getopt(1) implementations.

=======================

 - the build system is non-recursive, individual subdirectories use
   Makemodule.am files. These files are merged together by automake
   into one global Makefile in the top-level directory

 - all final build results (binaries, libtool scripts) are stored in top-level
   source directory

 - all Makemodule.am files have to be designed as top-level makefiles, it
   means with full paths (e.g. foo_SOURCES = subdir/foo.c)

 - always use '+=' operator for global variables (e.g. bin_PROGRAMS += foo)

 - use libcommon.la (without path!) for lib/ stuff (e.g. foo_LDADD = libcommon.la)

 - for libblkid, libuuid and libmount use lib<name>.la in _LDADD and
   -I$(ul_lib<name>_incdir) in _CFLAGS, for example

	foo_LDADD = libmount.la
	foo_CFLAGS = -I$(ul_libmount_incdir)

 - always use suffixes for hooks, for example

	install-exec-hook-foo:
		ln -sf foo foooo

	INSTALL_EXEC_HOOKS += install-exec-hook-foo


 - all util-linux specific autoconf macros use UL_ prefix

 - utils in Makefile.am files are enabled/disabled according to BUILD_<NAME>
   conditions (AM_CONDITIONAL), for example:

	if BUILD_HWCLOCK
	...
	endif

 - "if BUILD_<NAME>" blocks are never nested within another "if BUILD_<NAME>",
   all dependencies have to be resolved in configure.ac (see UL_REQUIRES_BUILD())

 - all BUILD_<NAME> in configure.am are always based on build_<name> variables,
   for example:

	AM_CONDITIONAL([BUILD_HWCLOCK], test "x$build_hwclock" = xyes)

   the $build_<name> should be available in whole configure script

 - AC_ARG_ENABLE() status is always stored in $enable_<name> variable, possible
   setting:

	"check" - util/feature is optional, if any subcomponent (function, lib,
                  ...) is missing a warning is printed and the util/feature is
                  disabled

	"yes"	- util/feature is required, if any subcomponent (function, lib,
                  ...) is missing an error is printed and ./configure aborted

	"no"	- the util/feature is unwanted

   The default status is always defined by UL_DEFAULT_ENABLE() and it might be
   globally modified by $ul_default_estate (see AC_ARG_ENABLE([all-programs])).

 - it's possible to disable all programs, but enable just one (or more)
   explicitly specified, for example:

        ./configure --disable-all-programs --enable-hwclock

 - some basic scenarios for the ./configure script are defined in the
   tools/config-gen.d/ directory. If you want to use these predefined scenarios
   then call

	./tools/config-gen [<scenario> ...]

   for example

	./tools/config-gen all selinux

   will build all utils with enabled selinux support. You can also define some
   CFLAGS, for example:

	CFLAGS=$(rpm --eval '%optflags') ./tools/config-gen all

   will use the default distro flags.

   WARNING: config-gen is not designed for end-user or downstream distributions!
            It's for development purpose only. All end-users and downstream have
            to use standard ./configure script only.

 - the tools/config-gen script is also used for build system regression tests,
   the test is not enabled by default, you have to use

	tests/run.sh build-sys --force

	./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

	  If something fails read the last lines. Typical reason to
	  fail is a missing dependency, such as libtool or gettext.

        make install-strip

	  Note that on the production systems it is strongly recommended to use
	  "make install-strip" to install binaries and libraries. The result
	  from the standard "make install" may produce large binaries with
	  unnecessary symbols.

Autotools

	`./autogen.sh' generates all files needed to compile
	and install the code (run it after checkout from git)

	`make distclean' removes all unnecessary files, but the
	code can still be recompiled with "./configure; make"

	`make dist-gzip' (or -bzip2) creates a tarball that can
	be configured and compiled without running `./autogen.sh'

Compiling

	Use SUID_CFLAGS and SUID_LDFLAGS when you want to define
	special compiler options for typical suid programs, for
	example:

	./configure SUID_CFLAGS="-fpie" SUID_LDFLAGS="-pie"

	The SUID_* feature is currently supported for chfn, chsh,
	newgrp, su, write, mount, and umount.

	Use DAEMON_CFLAGS and DAEMON_LDFLAGS when you want to define
	special compiler options for daemons; supported for uuidd.

	Use SOLIB_CFLAGS and SOLIB_LDFLAGS when you want to define
	special compiler options for shared libraries; supported for
	libmount, libblkid and libuuid.

	FIXME: add notes about klib and uClib.


Compile certain portion

	See ./configure --help and use --disable-* and --enable-* options.

        It's also possible to disable all the programs and enable only wanted.
        For example:

	./configure --disable-all-programs --enable-fallocate

	Note that the configure script tracks dependencies between libs and
        tools. Always see warning messages and follow error messages if any
        dependence is necessary. For example to compile mount(8) you need also
        libmount, libblkid and libuuid:

	./configure --disable-all-programs --enable-mount --enable-libmount \
                    --enable-libblkid --enable-libuuid


Static linking

	Use --enable-static-programs[=LIST] configure option when
	you want to use statically linked programs.

	Note, mount(8) uses get{pw,gr}nam() and getpwuid()
	functions for translation from username and groupname to
	UID and GID. These functions could be implemented by
	dynamically loaded independent modules (NSS) in your libc
	(e.g. glibc). These modules are not statically linked to
	mount(8) and mount.static is still using dlopen() like
	dynamically linked version.

	The translation won't work in environment where NSS
	modules are not installed.

	For example normal system (NSS modules are available):

		# ./mount.static -v -f -n -ouid=kzak /mnt/foo
		LABEL=/mnt/foo on /mnt/foo type vfat (rw,uid=500)
							 ^^^^^^^
	and without NSS modules:

		# chroot . ./mount.static -v -f -n -ouid=kzak /mnt/win
		LABEL=/mnt/win on /mnt/win type vfat (rw,uid=kzak)
							 ^^^^^^^^

=============================

How to deal libtool
-------------------

There are considerations to be made when profiling or debugging some programs
found in the util-linux package. Because wrapper scripts are used for the
binaries to make sure all library dependencies are met, you cannot use tools
such as gdb or valgrind directly with them.

Let's take for example the mount command:

	$> cd /path/to/util-linux
	$> file mount/mount
	mount/mount: Bourne-Again shell script text executable

The binary itself is located in the mount/.libs/ directory:

	$> file mount/.libs/mount
	mount/.libs/mount: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 \
	(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs) [...]

When this command is run, there's a library dependency error:

	$> mount/.libs/mount
	mount/.libs/mount: /lib/libblkid.so.1: version `BLKID_2.20' not found \
	(required by mount/.libs/mount)

To overcome this we need set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to read the path of
the shared lib found in the sources, and not system-wide:

	$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/libblkid/src/.libs/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Now external debugging tools can be run on the binary.

Happy hacking!

The libmount & libblkid
-----------------------

Both of the libraries can be debugged by setting an environment variable
consisting of a number. The number will be used as a bit mask, so the more 1 the
higher the debugging level. Search for `DEBUG' from files

	libblkid/src/blkidP.h
	libmount/src/mountP.h

to see what the different bits mean. At the time of writing this the following
enabled full debug.

	export LIBBLKID_DEBUG=all
	export LIBMOUNT_DEBUG=all
	export LIBFDISK_DEBUG=all
	export LIBSMARTCOLS_DEBUG=all

The libblkid reads by default /etc/blkid.conf which can be overridden by the
environment variable BLKID_CONF. See manual libblkid/libblkid.3 for details
about the configuration file.

Block device information is normally kept in a cache file (see blkid man page
for more information about the cache file location) that can be overridden by
the environment variable BLKID_FILE.

To libmount uses three paths, which can be overridden by using environment
variables. Notice that these environment variables are ignored for non-root
users.

	env variable		if not set defaults to
	LIBMOUNT_FSTAB		/etc/fstab
	LIBMOUNT_MTAB		/etc/mtab
	LIBMOUNT_UTAB		/run/mount/utab or /dev/.mount/utab

 util-linux regression tests
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 It's expected that for each invasive change or important bugfix you will
 include a test to your patch.

 Compile binaries, libs, extra test programs and run the basic tests:

	$ make check

 Compile extra test programs only:

	$ make check-programs

 Note that the configure option --disable-static disables many of libmount and
 libblkid unit tests.

 Run all tests including tests that require root permissions:

	# cd tests
	# ./run.sh [options, see --help]

	Alternatively using sudo and make:

	$ make check-programs
	$ sudo -E make check TS_OPTS="--parallel=1"

 note that as root you have to manually remove output and diff directories

	# rm -rf output diff

 or run 'make clean' as root.


 Run subset of tests:

	$ cd tests
	$ ./run.sh <test_directory-name>

        for example:

              $ ./run.sh blkid
              $ ./run.sh libmount

        or individual test script, for example:

	      $ ./ts/cal/year

 The tests is possible to exclude by ./run.sh --exclude=<list>  where the
 <list> is blank separated test names in format "testdir/testname", for example:

	$ ./run.sh --exclude="mount/move"

 The --exclude is evaluated by the ./run.sh script only. See below

	TS_OPT_testdir_[testscript_]fake=

 environment variable which provides more powerful functionality to skip tests.


 *** WARNING for root users ***

 The tests touch your /etc/fstab, initialize loop devices or scsi_debug devices
 if executed with root permissions.

 Please, be careful and use these tests only for development and never on
 production system.

fuzz targets
------------

The fuzz targets can be built and run along with the other tests (after installing
clang):

	$ ./tools/config-gen fuzz
	$ make check

environment variables
---------------------

TS_COMMAND

    Evaluated by "make check" to override the default command (run.sh).
    Example:
      - build all test dependencies, but skip the actual test
        $ make check TS_COMMAND="true"

TS_OPTS

    Evaluated by "make check" to pass options.to run.sh (see ./run.sh --help).
    Examples:
      - run utmp tests only
        $ make check TS_OPTS="--parallel=1 utmp"

TS_OPT_testdir_[testscript_]fake="<yes|no>"

    Evaluated by any test script to skip certain tests.
    Examples:
      - skip all the tests within "fdisk" test-directory:
        $ make check TS_OPT_fdisk_fake="yes"

      - skip only "fdisk/bsd" test:
        $ make check TS_OPT_fdisk_bsd_fake="yes"

      - skip all "fdisk" tests except fdisk/bsd:
        $ make check TS_OPT_fdisk_fake="yes" TS_OPT_fdisk_bsd_fake="no"

TS_OPT_testdir_[testscript_]known_fail="<yes|no>"

    Similar usage like TS_OPT_*_fake above. "known_fail" means that the given
    test will run but (negative) results will be ignored. The build log and test
    diffs will still remind you about the issue.

TS_OPT_testdir_[testscript_]verbose="<yes|no>"

    Set verbosity for certain tests. Similar usage like TS_OPT_*_fake above.

TS_OPT_testdir_[testscript_]memcheck="<yes|no>"

    Run certain tests with valgrind. Similar usage like TS_OPT_*_fake above.

Some notes for using agetty with modems

Using a comms program to initialize the modem
---------------------------------------------

* Use kermit or minicom to initialize the modem to

	- be entirely quiet.
	- don't do local echo in command mode.
	- turn on DCD (carrier detect) only when there is a connection going.
	- enable auto-answer.
	- keep a constant computer/modem bitrate at all times.
	- optionally save this setup as the modem startup configuration.

* Run agetty on the appropriate ttySn port with the arguments:
	* -w to wait for a CR or LF before writing the /etc/issue message
	* computer/modem bitrate
	* the tty name.

Example from my modem setup, an old 2400 bps SupraModem using Hayes standard
AT commands.

Initialize modem using kermit with the commands

	AT E0 Q1 &D2 &C1 S0=1 &W0

to
	- turn off local echo from modem when in command mode (E0).
	- disable all result codes from modem (Q1).
	- make an on/off transition on the DTR line make the modem
	  disconnect and go into command mode (&D2).
	- make the computer/modem DCD line track the modem/modem
	  carrier detect signal, i.e. no connection means no
	  carrier detect signal to the computer (&C1).
	- enable auto-answer after the first ring (S0=1).
	- store the configuration as the start configuration (&W0).

The commands on your modem to achieve the same setup may vary, especially
the &D2 and &C1 commands may not be entirely standard.

Exit kermit/minicom.

Put the command

	/sbin/agetty -w 2400 ttyS1

in the command field of the appropriate line in /etc/inittab to start
agetty on /dev/ttyS1 with a 2400 bps speed between modem and computer.

Initializing the modem with agetty
----------------------------------

Use the agetty -I command line option to specify a modem init string, like
for the same setup as above, use the following agetty command in your
/etc/inittab.

	/sbin/agetty -w -I 'ATE0Q1&D2&C1S0=1\015' 2400 ttyS1

The final \015 is an octal coding of the carriage return character
ending the command string.

If you're using simpleinit (part of this package) instead of the SYSV
compatible init (you're most likely using the SYSV one!) then you must
remove the single quotes from the command line above.

Note that the &W0 command was not used here since the modem will be
initialized each time agetty starts.

With a V.34 (28.8 kbps) modem try starting with a command like:

	/sbin/agetty -w -I 'ATE0Q1&D2&C1S0=1\015' 115200 ttyS1

Note that agetty supports the higher (>9600 bps) serial speeds
directly, there's no need to use setserial to use the higher speeds.

== Notes to developers ==

	The final solution will be libmount/mount.c as the
	mount(8) command implementation. So, let's keep the
	current mount/* code in maintenance mode and don't try to
	rewrite it :-)

The "pg" utility is the historic System V equivalent to BSD's "more". This
is a free clone of it, and it is intended to conform to the SVID 4 as well
as the SUSv2 specification of this command.

Contrasting to the System V implementation, this one filters backspace
formatting sequences while searching, so you can comfortably search in nroff
output like manual pages.

----------------

The util-linux package uses the <major>.<minor>.<maintenance> version

release means an increment of the minor number.  The minor version is
incremented roughly twice per year.  The easiest way to estimate when
the next version will appear, is to look at the time stamp of the last
release.

Before each release there are a few release candidates, which will be
collectively tested.  During the test period changes to the code base
are restricted.  Usually there are two release candidates.

  what	 length		what will be accepted into upstream
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  rc1	 1-2 weeks	bug fixes only
  rc2	 1-2 weeks	translations, fatal/trivial bug fixes

The period between a release and the next release candidate can be considered
as the merge window.

The release tarball is generated by "make distcheck" command.

Release criteria
----------------

For all releases it is required that:

   - make checkincludes passes
   - make checkconfig passes
   - make distcheck passes
   - cd tests && ./run.sh passes
   - an out-of-tree build works
     (cd .. && mkdir build && cd build && ../util-linux/configure && make)

   - ideally: a build with uClibc works, and --with-slang works
